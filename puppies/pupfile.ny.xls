04/02/2016	Jasmine Buffalo - Golden Retriever / Mixed (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Retriever-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Senior	"Posted Breed: Golden Retriever / Mixed (long coat). Thank You Amazing Buffalo Volunteer Team!**JASMINE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION ** more information below.  The Buffalo Volunteers love it when their  RED JAR  is full!   Every week the volunteers put a dollar or two into their red jar and when the total reaches $500.00 they cheer because they can sponsor another transport to bring dogs out of high kill shelters in the south to Joyful Rescues where they will find their forever homes.    Hats off to all these wonderful humans.   If you look up the definition of “love”, all their names would show up! Jasmine was born about October 21, 2008 and 65 lbs. We heard that she was acquired by someone at 2 years old and then they had to give her up recently due to an issue, but that is all of the story.  We feel she must have been an outside dog, since her teeth are ground down probably from chewing rocks or her dog house/chain! We have also found a very large mass on of her abdomen that appears to be a mammary tumor. She will be seeing our vet soon and we will update you as we get more information. Its such a tragedy she spent her life chained outside she is an amazing girl who wants nothing but love and instead was forced to be alone day and night, sitting, wishing that someone would come pet her. She is wonderful with dogs, cats and kids. Rides well in the car and is good on leash.    Update:  Well, it seems her owners probably threw her away because she couldn't breed anymore. She has a baseball size mammary tumor hanging from her belly (also hard as a baseball), her blood test showed either a massive infection or cancer and so we did a chest xray and she has a tumor on her heart.  She is no longer for adoption, Katie will be loving her through hospice care and as of right now she is a happy, very happy, dog that is, probably, for the first time in her life in a home and is loved like a member of the family. It is a VERY difficult thing we do sometimes.....    No information is gathered when humans dump their dogs off at a high kill pound as the staff knows they are probably going to die and it's not worth the time and energy to interview the owners. Please understand that Joyful and our vets are doing the best we can to guess age, breed, and ultimate weight, but if you are looking for something exact and don't like surprises you may be served better with another shelter. Thank you for understanding.     Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

04/02/2016	Jax - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Garden City, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed (short coat). Jax is a handsome, fun-loving red ACD mix. He is approximately one year old and weighs 38 pounds. He is very sweet and loves being petted. Jax had a bit of a rough start to life – he had been in at least 2 homes and 2 shelters before he was rescued. When he came to us he was very stressed and didn't know how to interact very well. He had to learn how to play and how to be gentle with people, but he has learned that toys are great fun, that the television is not scary, and that his foster mom is not a chew toy!  Jax has learned to relax in the house and will happily lay on the floor with a toy or treat. He seems more relaxed outside though, and will perch on top of the garbage can to have the best vantage point to keep an eye on everything in the yard. He still has much to learn though, and will need patience and continued training. Jax is always up for an adventure – he loves going for walks or hikes.  He would make for a great jogging partner or agility dog. He is high energy, and needs an active family who has “dog experience” and who will continue to provide the physical and mental stimulation needed to make him a happy and adjusted member of his new family. Since he likes being outside so much, I think a home with a fenced yard would be best. And because of his high energy level, a home without small children is needed. Jax can be a little pushy in his play with other dogs, not picking up on cues that they no longer want to play. This can cause some friction, so maybe Jax should be an only dog or have a sibling who can handle this behavior. Jax is crate trained and house trained, but you have to watch him to know when he needs to go out. He is up to date on vaccinations, current on heart worm and flea and tick preventatives. He is neutered and microchipped. Jax is being fostered in Clarksville, TN COMPLETE AN APPLICATION http://www.acdra.org/#!adoption-application-/c21x6  EMAIL QUESTIONS TO: ksiliven@icloud.com

Meet Little Bear and you will fall in love! She was brought to Lollypop Farm because her previous owners couldn&#39;t care for her anymore.

04/02/2016	Emma Manzella - Dachshund (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund	Cuba, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Dachshund (long coat). Thank you Manzella Family!The Manzella family, owner of 123 Shoes in Fairport, NY, held a fundraiser that brought in enough money to sponsor their SECOND life-saving transport! The lucky 17 saved on this trip from our friends at two shelters in Virginia and West Virginia! To the Manzella Family we just want to say ONE....TWO.... and... THREE Thank You(s)!!!   Emma was born about May 14, 2014 and weighs about 10 lbs. Emma's human Dad heard we were coming down and met us to tearfully relinquish Emma to us with deep regret. He ADORED this girl, but there was a wife and child involved and Emma was not good with the child. Emma also has issues with some other dogs (we are finding her doing very well with the other dogs in her foster home) and anyone she doesn't know well. Still reading??? She is still young and playful, chases shadows, and can be a chewer. She'd like to be the dominant being in the home so we are looking for dog savvy humans who won't let her get away with it and she guards food and toys. Emma does prefer someone that is home much of the time (but does fairly well with crating). Like so many of these tiny dogs she can struggle with house training and potty floor pads are probably in her future. Still reading??? So, let's go over her good points! We all know that no one is perfect....  She is good on leash and enjoys car rides. We truly feel Emma needs a fenced yard so that no one is ever in danger of being bit, which she has not accomplished in life yet, but there have been close calls. The loves running around outside and inside and then she'll be ready to join you for snuggle time and a good belly rub. She also loves bath time and it's a good thing she's absolutely drop dead (which could have happened if she had ended up at another shelter) GORGEOUS!!!!  All of the above information was from her human Dad, but now we'll tell you what we've seen in only 1 week with us. We saw a lot of teeth at first, but a few treats and a little coaxing later she was in the arms of one of the female staff, shortly after that our male staff member had her walking on leash and picking her up to be carried, then she decided she loved another and another of us so we, truly, feel we are going to be able to find her the perfect home out there and someone is going to love her to pieces!  Doxies tend to have an aggressive streak so this isn't all that uncommon. Emma is doing very well in her foster home. She adores her humans and enjoys playing with the smaller dogs in the house. Emma loves to play with stuffed toys and certainly knows what treats are all about! She uses potty pads in the house, but has been out the doggy door also. She is a real snuggler, especially with her human dad.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $225.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

04/02/2016	Blair Chimera - Chihuahua (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chihuahua	Cuba, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Chihuahua (short coat). I'm From The Chimera Transport!The Chimera transport is named in memory of three amazing women in my family? Mary Ann (mom), Barbara (aunt), and Clara (grandmother). They all raised me and sacrificed much to give me a chance in this world. The reason I choose to sponsor Southern transports is to give a chance to the ""underdog"". Homeless dogs and cats from the south often have the odds against them to live a happy, long life with a family to call their own. Every week we read about the stories and see the pictures of those lucky animals who make it up north. It is magical how a little four legged friend can bring joy and companionship into a home. They also know they hit the lucky Joyful Rescues jackpot! When I look into the eyes of my little southern rescue Piper, I can see pure joy and love. Being able to share that gift with other deserving families brings me great happiness. Every animal deserves to be loved and cared for. these transports give that chance to many luck passengers! ~ Michelle Alessi   Blair was born about December 16, 2013 and weighs about 8 lbs. She is a teeny, tiny, package of love and sweetness once she gets to know you. She is going to need some gentle warm up time and is typical Chihuahua nippy unless she knows you.  No information comes from the dogs in the south, but we are going to guess that she is going to struggle with house training as so many of these tiny dogs do and he may struggle throughout life causing you to want to have potty floor pads handy for those times she just can't hold it. She is wonderful with other dogs and that is about all we know so far. We sure are glad she make the trip! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $250.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.Rousey came to our shelter in December from Yonkers Animal Shelter, where she had been for over a year. This is an eternity in a city shelter. While there, she was not allowed toys or bedding and she was only brought outside 1-2 times a day by volunteers who loved her very much. Throughout all of that time and living in those conditions, Rousey never showed anything but love for the people around her. She soaked up any attention and belly rubs she could get and waited, knowing someday soon she would have a better life! Now that she is at our shelter, she is allowed toys, soft bedding, and she gets out of her kennel run much more often! Life is better for Rousey, but our shelter still is not a home, and that is what she needs and truly deserves. Rousey is very sweet and loves people, but she can be very toy obsessed, after not being allowed any for so long, so we are looking to place her in a home without children. For this reason we also would like to place her as an only pet, although on walks she is very polite when passing other dogs. She seems to possibly be housebroken and she is looking for a loving and understanding home to call her own, preferably somewhere with a comfortable bed to snuggle into!

Lando is a one-in-a-million dog. He is stunning and has the personality to back up the good looks! He unfortunately has not be treated as he deserves for most of his young life. He ended up as a stray and was brought to a city shelter where he stayed for way too long of a time. His time in that shelter led to bad habits and him having a difficult time connecting with new people. Since arriving at Adopt-A-Dog, we have seen a nice change in Lando's personality and sociability with new people. He now is always ready to give a kiss and get a hug! We are looking to place him as an only pet with older teenagers right now, until we know him better, but we will update his bio as we get to know him better!  Please give him the shot to show off what a great dog he is! Put in an application here: docs.google.com/forms/d/1J_maXSB5ckf0d_9vtixBIwMbCh2YouenDPUDGqyue5M/viewform

04/02/2016	Lincoln Paladino - Collie / Husky / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Collie-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Male	Baby	"Posted Breed: Collie / Husky / Mixed. James Patrick ""Paladino"" Transport! Lincoln was born about January 27, 2016 and ""may"" end up weighing in the 50 lb. range like mom, our Yeti, but we have no idea what dad was so these pups may be a surprise package. Please don't let the cuteness get in the way and be sure you are OK with the ultimate outcome of these babies. We don't want our dogs thrown away because they get too big. Thank you.  This transport is in honor and loving memory of our nephew, Patrick James Paladino, who passed away suddenly at the young age of 29. He was a devilish sort of boy, with a smile that would take your breath away and one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen. His sidekick and best friend, Duke, an American Staffordshire Bulldog, went everywhere with Patrick and the bond they shared was incredible. Duke now can be see everywhere with Patrick's father, Carl and is a permanent fixture on any of the couches in the Ellicott Square offices.  Many years ago a small, white dog ""supposedly"" followed Pat home from school. He begged his mother to let him keep him; she did. He named him Buttons and had him for years. This is one of my favorite stories about Pat, as I feel he rescued this dog long before Animal Rescues ever existed.  Joe and I chose rescue as our way to honor Patrick.  We can see him smiling as this wonderful rescue is about to take place in his name. We also felt we wanted to mention the three humans whose lives were also saved due to his parents selfless act of choosing organ donation.   Patrick, your nieces and nephews are very excited about this and have already picked out names. So let this journey begin and load up this truck, with your spirit protecting and guiding our precious transporters to where the once abandoned and abused will be rescued and cared for, until that special soul comes along that will give them their second chance at life, their forever home and most of all, love, just like you did that day you rescued Buttons so many years ago. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $400.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.    Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.   YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES     We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list.

04/02/2016	Azure - Shepherd / Husky / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Whitestone, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: Shepherd / Husky / Mixed (short coat). Needs training. Showing signs of dominance and rough play. Should go to a home experienced with this breed.                
04/02/2016	Lil House Pup Charles - Cattle Dog / Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Jack Russell Terrier-Unknown Mix	Fultonham, NY	Male	Baby	Posted Breed: Cattle Dog / Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Meet the “Little House Pups” – puppies Charles, Half-Pint, Mary, Carrie, and Isaiah. These sweeties are not only way-over-the-top adorable, they are also incredibly personable and people-oriented. Our best assessment is that they are a mix of Blue Heeler (aka Cattle Dog) and Jack Russell Terrier, with Mary and Carrie looking the most JRT as compared with the other 3. All of these pups are cutie-pies; they love to play, but they also love to cuddle and snuggle. In terms of energy/activity level, while all are active pups who will run as fast as they can to get to you for attention, Mary and Carrie are the most active. The boys, Charles and Isaiah, are a bit more laid back in terms of personality. And little Half-Pint is aptly named – this little snuggle-bug (and she is the smallest of the litter) is incredibly sweet & affectionate, but she is spunky enough to be able to hold her own with her larger siblings.  These pups are giving their foster mom lots of smiles with their antics & the tons of kisses that they all love to give!! And, an added joy is that they are smart and clean – they learned the doggie door in less than 2 minutes and have done amazingly well with pottying outside. We think these pups will range from small to medium (lower end of medium) when full grown, with Half-Pint being the smallest of the group.  If you have the time, willingness and ability to commit to one of these pups – for his or her whole life – no matter what may lie ahead in yours, please register on www.safeatlast.net (click Register on the left-hand side of our homepage). When you receive your password on your email account, then log back on to the website with your username and password to complete the SAFE AT LAST online adoption application (click Forms/Applications on the left-hand side of our homepage). Until we have your completed SAFE AT LAST application, we cannot consider you. We do NOT accept the applications of other organizations (including Petfinder, Adopt a Pet, All Paws, or any other organization). So, thank you for your cooperation and understanding.    Our review process starts with submission of your completed Safe At Last adoption application -- and then we will email you to schedule a phone interview. After that, we will call your references and perform a home assessment. An adoption fee of $375 (and a refundable $35 neuter deposit, required by NYS law) also apply. We are an all-volunteer organization, and we charge an adoption fee to cover our costs (medical, vetting, transport, food, etc) and to help other dogs in need. 100% of your adoption fee - every single cent - goes back to the rescue to pay for our costs and help other dogs, particularly those with special needs. We are all volunteers who take NOT ONE CENT, EVER. These pups are being fostered in a private home; we do not have a centralized facility. THEREFORE, YOU CANNOT MEET THE PUPS UNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR ADOPTION PER THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ALSO, we do not restrict by location, but ADOPTERS ARE REQUIRED TO COME TO THE FOSTER HOME (IN THIS CASE, FULTONHAM, NY) TO COMPLETE THE ADOPTION. WE DO NOT DELIVER OR SHIP OUR RESCUE ANIMALS.  If you have any questions, please email us at info@safeatlast.net. We are happy to assist. Thank you for your interest & for helping us save shelter pets, one life at a time.

I'm From The Chimera Transport!The Chimera transport is named in memory of three amazing women in my family? Mary Ann (mom), Barbara (aunt), and Clara (grandmother). They all raised me and sacrificed much to give me a chance in this world. The reason I choose to sponsor Southern transports is to give a chance to the ""underdog"". Homeless dogs and cats from the south often have the odds against them to live a happy, long life with a family to call their own. Every week we read about the stories and see the pictures of those lucky animals who make it up north. It is magical how a little four legged friend can bring joy and companionship into a home. They also know they hit the lucky Joyful Rescues jackpot! When I look into the eyes of my little southern rescue Piper, I can see pure joy and love. Being able to share that gift with other deserving families brings me great happiness. Every animal deserves to be loved and cared for. these transports give that chance to many luck passengers! ~ Michelle Alessi   Shaugnessy was born about March 16, 2006 and weighs about 15 lbs. He came to us a tattered mess of fur and mats and we've done our best to trim him up, but your groomer will have him looking schnazzy in no time! He is sweet as can be and a very happy lap companion. He is wonderful with the other dogs and all of us. No information comes with the southern dogs so this is all we know so far and will be learning as we go. Of course we do hope he finds a forever home before we get to know him too much, for his sake. His name may be a mouthful, but it means ""brings charm"". The Adoption Fee for this dog is $275.00.

04/02/2016	Echo - Chihuahua (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chihuahua	Cuba, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Chihuahua (medium coat). I'm One of Those Sweet Chihuahuas!Echo was born about March 19, 2015 and weighs about 10 lbs. She is absolutely adorable in all her chocolate lushness! Her fur is a bit on the thick, medium length, side for a Chihuahua so she may be mixed with something, we truly do not know. She's been around kids and has done well, she is good in the car and wonderful with other dogs and cats. She is a happy go lucky, playful, type girl that is looking for a new home because her elderly owner is having some health related breathing problems. As with so many of these tiny dogs Echo is struggling with house training and will need some work. We also want to warn you that so many of these tiny dogs continue to struggle throughout life and benefit from having potty floor pads around.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $375.00.

04/02/2016	Pearl - American Eskimo Dog / Mixed (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Eskimo Dog-Unknown Mix	Rochester, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: American Eskimo Dog / Mixed (long coat). Further information, applications and available pets can be found at http://www.rescued-treasures.comThis is Pearl . She is approximately 6 years old and was brought to us from a shelter in Kentucky. She was probably used as a breeding dog that had outlived her use. She came to us very scared, but she quickly learned that she was safe. She is very sweet and likes to be around people. She is crate trained, but she mostly stays in a bedroom with the door closed when necessary. It may take her some time to warm up to people (men especially), but a gentle voice and slow hand will win her over. She is comfortable enough now that she will stand on her hind legs and very gently put her front paws on you so you can pet her. She will stare at you sweetly with those gorgeous chocolate brown eyes of hers. She is potty trained, very respectful of the house rules, and rarely barks. She likes sleeping on the bed, but at the foot. If she isn't invited on the bed, she is just as comfortable on the floor. She likes dogs, ignores the cats (and the cats in her foster house rub up on her so they are hard to ignore!), likes kids, and really likes her foster mommy. She will be a great dog for a quieter family or multi-animal household. She is a joy to have in the house.  If you would like to meet this pet, please fill out an application at http://rescued-treasures.com/dog-application/ Rescued Treasures also has a facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/RescuedTreasuresPetAdoptions . Before applying for this dog, please think the decision over thoroughly and make sure the whole family is in agreement. Owning a dog is a huge responsibility that is not something that should be rushed into. Each dog from Rescued Treasures has been saved from an uncertain future. If you are thinking about adopting, please remember it is a LIFE-LONG commitment. Dogs can live to be at least 14 plus years old...are you ready to take care of him/her that long?

SASSY  was a special plea for help from our friends in North Carolina. Sassy had been rescued not too long ago off the streets by a lady who loved her dearly. This good samaritan kept Sassy for as long as she could but she has MS and it progressed to the point where she could no longer care for either herself or Sassy. She was put in assisted living and Sassy went to the shelter.Sassy was 18 months old in January, 2016. She has been through so much at such a young age and if you look in those eyes of hers, you can see the pain and longing she has for a home of her own. We are asking for a home for Sassy where she will be the one and only so she can get the care and attention she needs and deserves. Sassy is currently with a short term foster in Charlotte, NC and she is in dire need of a home. Please open your heart and then your home to give Sassy the chance she has been waiting for.

04/02/2016	Oskar - Mastiff / Golden Retriever (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mastiff	New York, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Mastiff / Golden Retriever (medium coat). Please contact Jeannie (toomanyshepherds@aol.com) for more information about this pet.Oskar is a 1 1/2 year old Mastiff/ Golden Retreiver mix who was rescued by a kind lady when he was found bleeding at a bakery near the Mexican border. When first found, poor Oskar was only 32 pounds - after 4 months of love and TLC he is now a healthy 70 pounds. At his foster home, he lived with a Chihuahua, a Pit Bull, two Labs, 3 Collie mixes and 5 other dogs. He was adopted through this group of good samaritans who help dogs from these desperate situations to a lovely lady in NYC. Sadly, due to his love of chasing squirrels, she has difficulty handling him due to previous back surgery. Oskar is a truly adorable, playful and loveable dog. He is great with people and loves children. He loves to cuddle. Inside the house he is calm and relaxed, quiet and housebroken. He does love playing outside so his rescuers feel he'd probably do better in a home where he has a big yard to play with and more family members to interact with. If you are interested in this charming boy, please contact Mindelacu@aol.comPlease complete our online Adoption Application. It is the first step toward bringing home your new family member. You may arrange to meet the dogs only by appointment and after your adoption application has been approved. If you should have any questions, please don't hesitate to Email Us.

Samson and his brother Skyler came to us all the way from KY. Both of these boys are positively gorgeous and SWEET as SUGAR!! They are doing so well, learning to walk on a leash (and they love those long walks) and learning ""sit"" and some other basics. Most of all, these pups are absolute, total love bugs. Sweeter pups, you could not find. And they are just stunningly handsome!!These boys are German Shep mixes, and we anticipate they will be large dogs when full grown. Right now, they are about 35 lbs, & we estimate their age to be between 4 and 4.5 months. These pups are sweethearts, and we are seeking great homes for them. While it would be terrific if they could go home together, we do believe each would do fine if adopted out as a single pup.If you are interested in committing to provide one or both of these boys a home for his whole life (no matter what may lie ahead in yours), please register on www.safeatlast.net.

I'm From The Chimera Transport!The Chimera transport is named in memory of three amazing women in my family? Mary Ann (mom), Barbara (aunt), and Clara (grandmother). They all raised me and sacrificed much to give me a chance in this world. The reason I choose to sponsor Southern transports is to give a chance to the ""underdog"". Homeless dogs and cats from the south often have the odds against them to live a happy, long life with a family to call their own. Every week we read about the stories and see the pictures of those lucky animals who make it up north. It is magical how a little four legged friend can bring joy and companionship into a home. They also know they hit the lucky Joyful Rescues jackpot! When I look into the eyes of my little southern rescue Piper, I can see pure joy and love. Being able to share that gift with other deserving families brings me great happiness. Every animal deserves to be loved and cared for. these transports give that chance to many luck passengers! ~ Michelle Alessi   Clover was born about December 15, 2015 and may top out in the 50 lb. range. This little girl is just simply happy, loving, full of life and love. She should fit in about any home with, relative, ease. Usually no information comes from the dogs in the south, but we do know she was picked up stray.  We are really guessing at breed, whatever she is sure a beauty. She is wonderful with other dogs and that is about all we know so far. We sure are glad she make the trip! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $350.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

My name is BABY ZENA and I'm a gorgeous 5 mo purebred Blk/Brown German Shepherd. I was surrendered by my owner due to NO TIME. I'm about 25 lbs of pure SUGAR AND SPICE. I am very sweet and smart, but I'm very confident and can be pushy with people and other dogs. I have puppy energy and am in my chewing stage so everything is a chew toy. I'm just learning to walk on a leash but sometimes I will jump at fast moving objects i.e bikes, runners and little kids that are running .. but these are all puppy behaviors and I'm learning better manners every day. I need to go to someone who has had experience with my breed and can keep up with my puppy energy and will continue to work on training me everyday. I would love to go with another dog preferably a large breed male dog that I can also learn from. I seem to be ok with cats at my young age but I do like to chase them. Since I like to jump on young kids, it's best if I go with older kids ages 10 yrs+. Last but not least, I would prefer a large fenced in yard to run around in. If you have the time, experience and environment to provide me, pls come meet/adopt me today!! For more info/app; pls email your phone# to: CECE@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG

04/02/2016	Bonnie Paladino - Collie / Husky / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Collie-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Baby	"Posted Breed: Collie / Husky / Mixed. James Patrick ""Paladino"" Transport! Bonnie was born about January 27, 2016 and ""may"" end up weighing in the 50 lb. range like mom, our Yeti, but we have no idea what dad was so these pups may be a surprise package. Please don't let the cuteness get in the way and be sure you are OK with the ultimate outcome of these babies. We don't want our dogs thrown away because they get too big. Thank you.  This transport is in honor and loving memory of our nephew, Patrick James Paladino, who passed away suddenly at the young age of 29. He was a devilish sort of boy, with a smile that would take your breath away and one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen. His sidekick and best friend, Duke, an American Staffordshire Bulldog, went everywhere with Patrick and the bond they shared was incredible. Duke now can be see everywhere with Patrick's father, Carl and is a permanent fixture on any of the couches in the Ellicott Square offices.  Many years ago a small, white dog ""supposedly"" followed Pat home from school. He begged his mother to let him keep him; she did. He named him Buttons and had him for years. This is one of my favorite stories about Pat, as I feel he rescued this dog long before Animal Rescues ever existed.  Joe and I chose rescue as our way to honor Patrick.  We can see him smiling as this wonderful rescue is about to take place in his name. We also felt we wanted to mention the three humans whose lives were also saved due to his parents selfless act of choosing organ donation.   Patrick, your nieces and nephews are very excited about this and have already picked out names. So let this journey begin and load up this truck, with your spirit protecting and guiding our precious transporters to where the once abandoned and abused will be rescued and cared for, until that special soul comes along that will give them their second chance at life, their forever home and most of all, love, just like you did that day you rescued Buttons so many years ago.

Lincoln was born about January 27, 2016 and ""may"" end up weighing in the 50 lb. range like mom, our Yeti, but we have no idea what dad was so these pups may be a surprise package. Please don't let the cuteness get in the way and be sure you are OK with the ultimate outcome of these babies. We don't want our dogs thrown away because they get too big. Thank you.  This transport is in honor and loving memory of our nephew, Patrick James Paladino, who passed away suddenly at the young age of 29. He was a devilish sort of boy, with a smile that would take your breath away and one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen. His sidekick and best friend, Duke, an American Staffordshire Bulldog, went everywhere with Patrick and the bond they shared was incredible. Duke now can be see everywhere with Patrick's father, Carl and is a permanent fixture on any of the couches in the Ellicott Square offices.  Many years ago a small, white dog ""supposedly"" followed Pat home from school. He begged his mother to let him keep him; she did. He named him Buttons and had him for years. This is one of my favorite stories about Pat, as I feel he rescued this dog long before Animal Rescues ever existed.  Joe and I chose rescue as our way to honor Patrick.  We can see him smiling as this wonderful rescue is about to take place in his name. We also felt we wanted to mention the three humans whose lives were also saved due to his parents selfless act of choosing organ donation.   Patrick, your nieces and nephews are very excited about this and have already picked out names. So let this journey begin and load up this truck, with your spirit protecting and guiding our precious transporters to where the once abandoned and abused will be rescued and cared for, until that special soul comes along that will give them their second chance at life, their forever home and most of all, love, just like you did that day you rescued Buttons so many years ago. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $400.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

04/02/2016	Lil House Pup Isaiah - Cattle Dog / Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Jack Russell Terrier-Unknown Mix	Fultonham, NY	Male	Baby	Posted Breed: Cattle Dog / Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Meet the “Little House Pups” – puppies Isaiah (aka Mr. Edwards), Half-Pint, Mary, Carrie, and Charles. These sweeties are not only way-over-the-top adorable, they are also incredibly personable and people-oriented. Our best assessment is that they are a mix of Blue Heeler (aka Cattle Dog) and Jack Russell Terrier, with Mary and Carrie looking the most JRT as compared with the other 3. All of these pups are cutie-pies; they love to play, but they also love to cuddle and snuggle. In terms of energy/activity level, while all are active pups who will run as fast as they can to get to you for attention, Mary and Carrie are the most active. The boys, Charles and Isaiah, are a bit more laid back in terms of personality. And little Half-Pint is aptly named – this little snuggle-bug (and she is the smallest of the litter) is incredibly sweet & affectionate, but she is spunky enough to be able to hold her own with her larger siblings.  These pups are giving their foster mom lots of smiles with their antics & the tons of kisses that they all love to give!! And, an added joy is that they are smart and clean – they learned the doggie door in less than 2 minutes and have done amazingly well with pottying outside. We think these pups will range from small to medium (lower end of medium) when full grown, with Half-Pint being the smallest of the group.

Please contact Debbie (resqmom54@icloud.com) for more information about this pet.  This little girl is Butterscotch. She is a Havanese, about 5 years old and only weighs 7 pounds. Butterscotch spent the first five years of her life in a puppy mill. She is making so much progress adapting to the good life and can't wait to learn more!     Are you looking for a lap warmer? Well Butterscotch is your girl! She loves to snuggle on the couch! And her sweet face and soulful eyes are irresistible and she will just melt your heart! Soft beds and laps are new to her and so much better then where she came from. After 5 years in a puppy mill, she is learning that people can be pretty amazing. She wants to be with her people as much as possible. Butterscotch is good with other dogs and would be most happy with another little dog or two to show her the ropes. Her ideal home would be with people that are patient and understanding. She is still working on her potty training but is smart and motivated. She should pick it up in no time. A fenced yard would be ideal since she is still learning to walk on a leash. She has been around children but would be happiest in an adult home.      Please research some of the challenges associated with puppy mill dogs.      Butterscotch is now spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm tested neg., wormed, and has been given a dental. She has also been groomed! Her adoption donation is $350.

Hey, Check Out My Profile!Haydee was born about June 19, 2014 and will probably top out in the 30 lb. range. This young lady is cute and unique! Her paperwork all says Lab mix, but that profile! Where did it come from? We'd love to hear your thoughts on her breed, but it does look a little like the profile of a Bull Terrier so that is our choice for now. She was found wandering in a nearby town. I just can't imagine how she was out on her own and no one was looking for her, she is adorable and just as sweet as she is cute. Haydee is playful, happy, and has done well in the car. She's wonderful with the other dogs and is ready for a fun filled life where no one will let her get lost again! Update: We noticed some odd behavior and and Dr. Hite at Camp Road Vet confirmed that Haydee has some neurological problems and perhaps she doesn't see just right, but she has sight and gets around fine. She is what she is and she's really happy and doesn't know she's a bit odd.  We are not sure if she has always been this way or has had trauma, but she is definitely improving as time goes on. This girl is a major snuggler, she's fun, funny, and happy just the way she is. We hope we can find that special human that will give this special little girl a real home. Haydee continues to thrive in our home, which is a quieter home with no small children (she does get along with children however). She likes to play with her foster brother who is the same age as Haydee, and she likes to lay next to, or on, her foster sister. To really get to know this girl you need to spend some time with her one on one. She is a real sweetheart who will follow you around everywhere and make sure you never feel alone. Haydee loves peanut butter and ice cubes in addition to rotisserie chicken and cheese. Even though she gets plenty of treats, she is slowly and steadily losing weight and her coat is getting fuller and glossier. Since the weather has gotten warmer we've taken Haydee on a few walks which she LOVES! Haydee is still on medicine for her urinary leaking and is doing really really well, and we wonder if her forever family will eventually be able to take her off of the medicine.  Do you have other dogs that you are looking for a companion for? Or maybe you are looking for your one and only dog? Maybe you are retired or work from home and are looking for some company? Do you embrace weirdness? Do you want a furry friend whose antics will make you smile? Haydee would be wonderful for you!        The Adoption Fee for this dog is $125.00.

04/02/2016	Aja - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Ardsley, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). It was a cold late night in the Bronx, two good Samaritans out for a walk saw something tied to a pole. It turned out to be a sweet young dog. Imagine being left tied up to a pole outside in the freezing cold without any way to get warm and left to fend for yourself. Now picture yourself in that same situation, but you are a blind pup with no way to know where you are or see if there is anyone around who can help you. That was the fate of Aja – our newest miracle pup. The good Samaritans did the right thing and called the police, however, they did not want her to end up at animal control so they decided to take her home, keep her safe, warm and take care of her. It was clear that Aja was either completely blind or could only see shadows based on her movements. She had a bit of trouble at first maneuvering around the apartment and bumped into walls and furniture, but once she managed to memorize the layout, she was fine. Aja even got along with her rescuers two cats and was very playful and excited with the dogs she encountered in the park.The only downfall - her good Samaritans realized they did not have the time to dedicate to her that she needed because of their work schedules. Wanting only the best for her - they reached out to Furbridge for help. Aja is now safe in foster care with us and is full of energy and just the sweetest dog. We have now had her to the vet who referred her to a specialist and the specialist let us know that Aja was born this way, her eyes never fully developing and thus, the deformity.  Aja is full of love, especially where it comes to children.The secret we would like to share is that Aja does not need eyes to see as she sees with her heart. Whomever adopts her will have a gem of a dog!.Donations are always welcome https://www.paypal.me/FurBridgeAdoption Application: http://beta.petstablished.com/adoption_form/1946/genericAja aka Goldie's Amazon Wishlist: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/318DFIBIOXQA5/ref=cm_wl_list_o_18?

She gets along very well with the other dogs in the home, and hasn't shown much interest in the cat. Jeanne loves to snuggle the entire night under the blankets with her foster mom.

The founder of the organization saw me and my siblings the previous day running around a property in rural SC. Her and a really nice man came to try to help us. The man who owns the property was kindly feeding us and happily helped her catch us so we could get all our basic vetting and then eventually find our forever homes. Not only did they get me and my 7 siblings, but they got my mommy and a friend of ours who they names Rudy. We were brought to the LCAR Sanctuary and Safe Haven in Carlisle, SC where were given warm beds, food and water. We stayed there until we were ""ready to go"". So we were all transported to NY in the hopes of finding our FOREVER homes. I am so glad we all were brought to safety and now have the chance to be part of someones family. But my story does not end there, my amazing adopter became very ill and had to surrender me back to the rescue, to no fault of my own, I again am looking for my family.

04/02/2016	Murdock - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Garden City, NY	Male	Young	"Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed (medium coat). Meet Murdock! One of the cutest and sweetest ACD mix puppies you will ever see! Murdock is a 14 pound, 10 week old ACD mix that was surrendered along with his six litter mates. He was born on January 10th, 2016. He was born with what is called Microphthalmia (also known as ""small eyes""). His eyes were never fully developed in the womb and therefore he is blind. He will live a normal life as a blind dog, he does not need eye drops, or surgery or anything like that. Sometimes we honestly forget he is blind, as he adapts so well and quickly to his surroundings.  Murdock is the most loving puppy we have had the privilege to foster and if you could hold him in your arms you would melt! He is a fun puppy, and follows you around everywhere. He is very respectful of foster siblings also. He plays very nicely and eats and shares his bones and toys well.  Murdock is a typical puppy though and needs lots of mental and physical stimulation. Puppy and training classes are highly recommended as it is a great benefit for him, and it also forms a special bond between dog parents and their new pup!  Murdock is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, as well as microchipped.   Murdock is currently being fostered in Long Valley, NJ. Questions?

04/02/2016	Lil House Pup Carrie - Jack Russell Terrier / Cattle Dog / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Jack Russell Terrier-Unknown Mix	Fultonham, NY	Female	Baby	Posted Breed: Jack Russell Terrier / Cattle Dog / Mixed (short coat). Meet the “Little House Pups” – puppies Carrie, Half-Pint, Mary, Charles and Isaiah. These sweeties are not only way-over-the-top adorable, they are also incredibly personable and people-oriented. Our best assessment is that they are a mix of Blue Heeler (aka Cattle Dog) and Jack Russell Terrier, with Mary and Carrie looking the most JRT as compared with the other 3. All of these pups are cutie-pies; they love to play, but they also love to cuddle and snuggle. In terms of energy/activity level, while all are active pups who will run as fast as they can to get to you for attention, Mary and Carrie are the most active. The boys, Charles and Isaiah, are a bit more laid back in terms of personality. And little Half-Pint is aptly named – this little snuggle-bug (and she is the smallest of the litter) is incredibly sweet & affectionate, but she is spunky enough to be able to hold her own with her larger siblings.  These pups are giving their foster mom lots of smiles with their antics & the tons of kisses that they all love to give!! And, an added joy is that they are smart and clean – they learned the doggie door in less than 2 minutes and have done amazingly well with pottying outside. We think these pups will range from small to medium (lower end of medium) when full grown, with Half-Pint being the smallest of the group.  If you have the time, willingness and ability to commit to one of these pups – for his or her whole life – no matter what may lie ahead in yours, please register on www.safeatlast.net (click Register on the left-hand side of our homepage). When you receive your password on your email account, then log back on to the website with your username and password to complete the SAFE AT LAST online adoption application (click Forms/Applications on the left-hand side of our homepage). Until we have your completed SAFE AT LAST application, we cannot consider you. We do NOT accept the applications of other organizations (including Petfinder, Adopt a Pet, All Paws, or any other organization). So, thank you for your cooperation and understanding.    Our review process starts with submission of your completed Safe At Last adoption application -- and then we will email you to schedule a phone interview. After that, we will call your references and perform a home assessment. An adoption fee of $375 (and a refundable $35 neuter deposit, required by NYS law) also apply. We are an all-volunteer organization, and we charge an adoption fee to cover our costs (medical, vetting, transport, food, etc) and to help other dogs in need. 100% of your adoption fee - every single cent - goes back to the rescue to pay for our costs and help other dogs, particularly those with special needs. We are all volunteers who take NOT ONE CENT, EVER. These pups are being fostered in a private home; we do not have a centralized facility. THEREFORE, YOU CANNOT MEET THE PUPS UNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR ADOPTION PER THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ALSO, we do not restrict by location, but ADOPTERS ARE REQUIRED TO COME TO THE FOSTER HOME (IN THIS CASE, FULTONHAM, NY) TO COMPLETE THE ADOPTION. WE DO NOT DELIVER OR SHIP OUR RESCUE ANIMALS.

04/02/2016	Brody - Australian Shepherd / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Australian Shepherd-Unknown Mix	Perry, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: Australian Shepherd / Mixed (medium coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Brody is a 1-year-old male Australian Shepherd mix. He's an incredibly sweet, affectionate dog who alternates between being absolutely gorgeous and completely goofy. He loves to play and hasn't put a foot wrong with other dogs, cats, and kids. Brody is still learning how to live in a house — sometimes he needs help with stairs or doors and he's not comfortable getting on the couch — but he's a very affectionate dog who loves belly rubs. He gets nervous on busy streets, but other than that walks great in a harness."" He is already up to date on vaccines, neutered and we will microchip him.  Brody's adoption fee is $250 which covers the medical expenses.  Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

04/02/2016	Aja - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Ardsley, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). It was a cold late night in the Bronx, two good Samaritans out for a walk saw something tied to a pole. It turned out to be a sweet young dog. Imagine being left tied up to a pole outside in the freezing cold without any way to get warm and left to fend for yourself. Now picture yourself in that same situation, but you are a blind pup with no way to know where you are or see if there is anyone around who can help you. That was the fate of Aja – our newest miracle pup. The good Samaritans did the right thing and called the police, however, they did not want her to end up at animal control so they decided to take her home, keep her safe, warm and take care of her. It was clear that Aja was either completely blind or could only see shadows based on her movements. She had a bit of trouble at first maneuvering around the apartment and bumped into walls and furniture, but once she managed to memorize the layout, she was fine. Aja even got along with her rescuers two cats and was very playful and excited with the dogs she encountered in the park.The only downfall - her good Samaritans realized they did not have the time to dedicate to her that she needed because of their work schedules. Wanting only the best for her - they reached out to Furbridge for help. Aja is now safe in foster care with us and is full of energy and just the sweetest dog. We have now had her to the vet who referred her to a specialist and the specialist let us know that Aja was born this way, her eyes never fully developing and thus, the deformity.  Aja is full of love, especially where it comes to children.The secret we would like to share is that Aja does not need eyes to see as she sees with her heart. Whomever adopts her will have a gem of a dog!.Donations are always welcome https://www.paypal.me/FurBridgeAdoption Application: http://beta.petstablished.com/adoption_form/1946/genericAja aka Goldie's Amazon Wishlist: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/318DFIBIOXQA5/ref=cm_wl_list_o_18?

Thank You Orchard Park Team!!!! What amazing volunteers we have! Just a few weeks ago, our volunteers at Orchard Park PetSmart sponsored their first transport and brought in the ""BUFFALO"" dogs. They decided once is just not enough, and already raised enough money to sponsor a second transport to save more lives! On top of that, they're doing an amazing job of finding them homes once we get them up here! What we do takes teamwork, and huge thanks to our Orchard Park volunteers for being part of our team!    Wayne was born about January 9, 2016 and we are guessing these pups will weigh in the 35 - 50 lb. range but we are sincerely guessing on breed and ultimate weight so if you don't like surprises this puppy is not for you. These pups are SO social, friendly, happy, well-adjusted and PLAYFUL!  We have no clue of what either parent was. These pups were dropped off at the shelter and no information was given, but they don't care, they are just HAPPY! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $375.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet.

04/02/2016	Donny - Pointer / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Pointer-Unknown Mix	Woodside, NY	Male	Young	"Posted Breed: Pointer / Mixed (short coat). FOSTER UPDATE: Donny wants you to know he's doing well! He says, ""I love being out of the shelter and in a home! It's so cozy and smells soooo much better! (Especially when my foster mom is cooking bacon). I'm becoming more confident and finally eating all my meals. And boy do I love getting lots of affection and hanging out with my foster parents! I may look like a tough guy but I'm actually a big softy. Please don't stereotype me by my ears, they weren't my choice. I love to snuggle, sit in your lap and give kisses. And I'll roll on my back and show you my soft, pink belly if you'll come scratch it! That's my favorite. I love to gently play tug of war. I love greeting my doggy neighbors with a friendly wagging tail and gentle sniffs. I'm really good at ""sit"" and ""down"", especially if you offer me something tasty. I'm graceful and soft footed and have long lean legs my foster mom says she's jealous of. And while she's pretty cool, I'm really excited about getting a forever home. Won't you give me a chance?""------------------------------------------------------------As soon as Donny arrived at a shelter in Long Island, he won the hearts of many staff and volunteers with his ridiculously special personality. Donny is super, super affectionate with his person (after just a little bit of time letting him get to know you), he knows many commands including “sit”, “heel”, “down” and “stay” and is even GREAT with dogs (he just keeps sounding better and better)!! But what's the most unique part about Donny you ask? Well, brace yourselves, because this handsome boy can sing! And you know Donny loves you when he sings to you… it was basically everyone’s goal at the shelter to have him serenade them with his beautiful voice, and now that he's coming to MPR, it's our goal too!If you're asking yourself why Donny's ears look a bit...different, that's because this poor boy had someone take their own scissors to his ears and try to ""crop"" them on their own. We can't imagine how much that must have hurt this handsome boy, but his hard life means that when he finds his forever family, he'll be so grateful they took a chance on him! But it also means we recommend he not go to a home with young kids right now; Donny can get easily scared because of what he's been through, so a calmer, loving household is what this boy needs.Now in NYC, Donny is a 3 year old pointer mix (possibly with some kind of bulldog) with all his medical done and ready to go home with a forever family he can sing his heart out to!This dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.

He was used as the helper dog for safer testing--meaning it doesn't get any better! Clearly great w/ other dogs, we'll check out his cat and kid manners but he certainly doesn't mind getting dressed up!:)    More Info: incredibly sweet and playful. never heard him bark, but he’ll prop his paws on his cage door and whine and wiggle when approached. He seems to keep his cage clean forever and does a little happy dance after he’s relieved himself outside. He seems very intelligent and is often provided with puzzle toys (he solves them in a jiffy!). He pulls some on the leash and is very interested in the goings-on around him, but once he’s focused there’s no better company — he's awesome!

04/02/2016	Macy - Labrador Retriever / Shepherd / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Adult	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Shepherd / Mixed (medium coat). I LOVE TO SWIM!!!!Macy was born about April 16, 2009 and weighs about 65-70 lbs. She is a soft, gentle, girl inside and out. Her coat is a medium length, much like a Shepherd, but her ears are down and the extent to her love of water is Lab all the way!!!  She is just wonderful with the other dogs and she's fine with cats. She grew up with a cat and kids both of which she was wonderful with. Why is she here? Well, ""the kids are getting older...."". She is house trained, good on leash and will hang with you while off leash as you are doing your outside chores, and she is great in the car. She is a wonderful companion as her humans mean the world to her (even sadder) and she will be beside you wherever you are, she's one of those cling on dogs. She is in wonderful shape, would not have guessed she is 6 but there is documentation of good vet care since she was a pup. About three years ago she began to ""scratch at the back door glass is she was accidentally left in the house"" when her family was outside. She has also scratched the wood next to the door and taken down a curtain trying to get to her humans. So, there may well be separation anxiety here so we will be looking for a home where humans are home much of the time and a home where she is completely a member of the household and will be able to be where her humans are whether in the house, on the deck, or in the yard. We have seen no anxiety and she's been a perfect house guest. It did take her about a week to settle in and realize they weren't coming back and she needed to move on and love us now. When she, again, finds a permanent home she may grieve for us, as she did her first family, but her love will transfer to you and we all hope this is the last time that she is put through loosing those she loves so very much. Macy does need someone willing to watch for repeated ear infections and treat as needed. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $275.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet.

The shelter manager reached out to us with a plea to help, and said that she felt like he had quite a bit more time and is happy and healthy and full of love! Roman isn't a candidate for the adoption floor because of his age, so Furbridge posted him hoping for a foster and we got one!

04/02/2016	Rescue Kolby - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Batavia, NY	Male	Young	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Kolby Labrador Retriever Mix 2 yr old/Male Kolby is an active dog who does great with other dogs and he walks well on a leash. Volunteers For Animals periodically pulls dogs for other shelters in need of moving animals to avoid euthanizing healthy, adoptable animals. We are able to do this through the generosity of many people such as the originating shelter staff, transporters, foster volunteers and others who help with pulling fees, vet bills and finding good homes once they are here. The adoption process includes an application that is completed by the potential owner. If there are multiple applications on the same animal, the animal will go to the best home for that particular animal - not necessarily the first application. Fees for the rescues animals can range from $50 to $150 per animal. If you are interested in any of these dogs, please email. Do not call the Shelter regarding rescue animals - they have no information. All rescue animals are in foster homes with volunteers - NOT at the Shelter - unless otherwise noted.  Here is the adoption process:   You must come to the Shelter to complete an application which is reviewed right away. If everything is okay you can meet any of the animals. All animals are $40, if they are not spay or neuter, there is a $35 refundable deposit that is returned upon proof of surgery.    If Volunteers For Animals spayed or neutered the animal, we are suggesting adopters make a donation of $35 to help with the cost of the surgery which is significantly less than if you had to go to a vet. All of that donation will go directly towards spaying and neutering the next animal we take into the Shelter. You will be helping to ""Spay it Forward"" and reduce the homeless pet population.    We only accept cash or checks. Please bring a carrier for cats to go home in or you can purchase a nice cardboard carrier for $5 from us. If you live in Genesee County, all dogs must be licensed before they leave the Shelter which is done through your city/town clerk's office (typically M-F 9-5). Please bring a leash when you pick up your new friend. Our adoption hours are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday 1-3; Wednesday 7-9 and Saturday 11-1.    If the cat or kitten is at Petco, you can go in anytime during Petco's store hours to complete an application and see the cat or kitten. Once a day a volunteer stops into the store to review applications and will call you with questions or let you know the adoption is approved. You can return to the store anytime to pay the adoption fee and pick up the cat or kitten. The adoption fee is $40, cash or check, and the animal must leave in a carrier.    Thank you for considering a homeless animal.                "
04/02/2016	Ladie Bug - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Rochester, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel. MARCH UPDATE: Ladie Bug had her first surgery for only one ear. The damage was so extensive that the surgeon could only get one ear done safely. She will now have to undergo another surgery in May to do the other ear. We feel awful having to put this sweet girl through this twice, but we know that this is going to help her live a long and much more comfortable life. She is recovering fairly well from the first surgery, but the surgeon feels that we should allow her a couple months to completely recover and adjust before undergoing the second surgery. We are still taking applications for Ladie while we help her through her recovery, so if you are interested, please submit your application for her today!UPDATE ON LADIE BUG: Poor little Ladie has a medical issue with chronic ear infections. Her ears were not taken care of properly over the years and the resulting damage is very extensive. The only way to heal her ears and eliminate her chronic issues is for her to have a surgery called a Total Ear Canal Ablation, that will remove the ear drums in both her ears. The doctors she has seen said she would adapt very well and use her sight and sense of smell to make up for her loss of hearing. We have done some research on the TECA surgery that she will be having, and in some cases the dogs are able to still hear a little. She will be having the surgery soon, and we will post an update on her status here. Please stay tuned! We are raising funds now to cover the cost of this surgery, which is estimated between $2,500 and $3,500, to help Ladie live comfortably for the rest of her life. If you would like to help us to pay for her surgery, please click here: https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=k5LgrpkCaPNyMyU9w0aZCEmOt7_HZZb5_4jDOvEg-HcDsaAWQ_oVwapNzH0&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d64ad11bbf4d2a5a1a0d303a50933f9b2 and it will take you to Paypal! Ladie Bug says Thank You for giving her this amazing gift!We are happy to introduce Ladie Bug, a sweet little Chocolate Cocker Spaniel girl of about 4 years old.

04/02/2016	Lil House Pup Half-Pint - Cattle Dog / Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Jack Russell Terrier-Unknown Mix	Fultonham, NY	Female	Baby	Posted Breed: Cattle Dog / Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Meet the “Little House Pups” – puppies Half-Pint, Mary, Carrie, Charles and Isaiah. These sweeties are not only way-over-the-top adorable, they are also incredibly personable and people-oriented. Our best assessment is that they are a mix of Blue Heeler (aka Cattle Dog) and Jack Russell Terrier, with Mary and Carrie looking the most JRT as compared with the other 3. All of these pups are cutie-pies; they love to play, but they also love to cuddle and snuggle. In terms of energy/activity level, while all are active pups who will run as fast as they can to get to you for attention, Mary and Carrie are the most active. The boys, Charles and Isaiah, are a bit more laid back in terms of personality. And little Half-Pint is aptly named – this little snuggle-bug (and she is the smallest of the litter) is incredibly sweet & affectionate, but she is spunky enough to be able to hold her own with her larger siblings.  These pups are giving their foster mom lots of smiles with their antics & the tons of kisses that they all love to give!! And, an added joy is that they are smart and clean – they learned the doggie door in less than 2 minutes and have done amazingly well with pottying outside. We think these pups will range from small to medium (lower end of medium) when full grown, with Half-Pint being the smallest of the group.  If you have the time, willingness and ability to commit to one of these pups – for his or her whole life – no matter what may lie ahead in yours, please register on www.safeatlast.net (click Register on the left-hand side of our homepage). When you receive your password on your email account, then log back on to the website with your username and password to complete the SAFE AT LAST online adoption application (click Forms/Applications on the left-hand side of our homepage). Until we have your completed SAFE AT LAST application, we cannot consider you. We do NOT accept the applications of other organizations (including Petfinder, Adopt a Pet, All Paws, or any other organization). So, thank you for your cooperation and understanding.    Our review process starts with submission of your completed Safe At Last adoption application -- and then we will email you to schedule a phone interview. After that, we will call your references and perform a home assessment. An adoption fee of $375 (and a refundable $35 neuter deposit, required by NYS law) also apply. We are an all-volunteer organization, and we charge an adoption fee to cover our costs (medical, vetting, transport, food, etc) and to help other dogs in need. 100% of your adoption fee - every single cent - goes back to the rescue to pay for our costs and help other dogs, particularly those with special needs. We are all volunteers who take NOT ONE CENT, EVER. These pups are being fostered in a private home; we do not have a centralized facility. THEREFORE, YOU CANNOT MEET THE PUPS UNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR ADOPTION PER THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ALSO, we do not restrict by location, but ADOPTERS ARE REQUIRED TO COME TO THE FOSTER HOME (IN THIS CASE, FULTONHAM, NY) TO COMPLETE THE ADOPTION. WE DO NOT DELIVER OR SHIP OUR RESCUE ANIMALS.  If you have any questions, please email us at info@safeatlast.net. We are happy to assist. Thank you for your interest & for helping us save shelter pets, one life at a time.

Lookin' for Large ?Falcon was born about February 8, 2016 and is one gigantic, romping, ball of blubber with legs! He is SO cute and SO Chow like in his very thick, medium length fur, and his waistline or lack of one. Also, Chow like is his energy level. He is social, happy, follows you around, but there is more down time than a ""normal"" puppy. He is said to be part Rott. and maybe that adds to his, very large, size. Please note, this puppy should not be fed puppy food as you want him to grow as slowly as possible for his bones to become thick. Also, since Chows are on the ""list"" of insurance companies his medical paperwork all says Retriever, which he surely could be part, who knows??  Also, this puppy is so Chow like that we are looking for humans with Chow experience as Chows are not for everyone, but if you love the breed you LOVE them!  He is with us because his mama ended up pregnant.... The Adoption Fee for this dog is $325.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

04/02/2016	Rescue Cassie - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Batavia, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Cassie Labrador Retriever Mix 1-2 yr old/Female Cassie is a sweet and outgoing dog who does great with other dogs and loves everyone she meets. Volunteers For Animals periodically pulls dogs for other shelters in need of moving animals to avoid euthanizing healthy, adoptable animals. We are able to do this through the generosity of many people such as the originating shelter staff, transporters, foster volunteers and others who help with pulling fees, vet bills and finding good homes once they are here. The adoption process includes an application that is completed by the potential owner. If there are multiple applications on the same animal, the animal will go to the best home for that particular animal - not necessarily the first application. Fees for the rescues animals can range from $50 to $150 per animal. If you are interested in any of these dogs, please email. Do not call the Shelter regarding rescue animals - they have no information. All rescue animals are in foster homes with volunteers - NOT at the Shelter - unless otherwise noted.  Here is the adoption process:   You must come to the Shelter to complete an application which is reviewed right away. If everything is okay you can meet any of the animals. All animals are $40, if they are not spay or neuter, there is a $35 refundable deposit that is returned upon proof of surgery.    If Volunteers For Animals spayed or neutered the animal, we are suggesting adopters make a donation of $35 to help with the cost of the surgery which is significantly less than if you had to go to a vet. All of that donation will go directly towards spaying and neutering the next animal we take into the Shelter. You will be helping to ""Spay it Forward"" and reduce the homeless pet population.    We only accept cash or checks. Please bring a carrier for cats to go home in or you can purchase a nice cardboard carrier for $5 from us. If you live in Genesee County, all dogs must be licensed before they leave the Shelter which is done through your city/town clerk's office (typically M-F 9-5). Please bring a leash when you pick up your new friend. Our adoption hours are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday 1-3; Wednesday 7-9 and Saturday 11-1.    If the cat or kitten is at Petco, you can go in anytime during Petco's store hours to complete an application and see the cat or kitten. Once a day a volunteer stops into the store to review applications and will call you with questions or let you know the adoption is approved. You can return to the store anytime to pay the adoption fee and pick up the cat or kitten. The adoption fee is $40, cash or check, and the animal must leave in a carrier.    Thank you for considering a homeless animal.                "

04/02/2016	Hope - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	New York, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). When we took Hope into rescue, she was starved, emaciated, and neglected. She had been found at the bottom of a well, crying for help, and barely able to stand any longer. We were unsure if we would lose her, she was so weak! We feel there is a strong possibility that she may have also been abused, because when she first entered her southern foster's home, she would cower and cringe with any quick movements. There is no doubt that Hope has had a hard life, and we want nothing more for her to experience the GOOD life! Hope is a good girl who like snuggles and kisses. She is housetrained and leash trained. She will need someone with lots of patience and willingness to provide consistent rules and boundaries, simply because she is learning to trust again, and consistency builds trust. When Hope first came into rescue, she did not know what toys were, or how to play. It broke our hearts to hear that she didnt even know the simplest pleasure! Hope will require slow intro to the home if other dogs are present, and should be fed away and seperate from the other dogs in the home. She is working on her socialization skills, so this is a must at this time. She is a good girl, who just needs a chance to learn what it is like to be part of a loving family and doing fun things!

She is said to be part Rott. and her brother may be, but we are thinking she may have had a different daddy (that can happen) as her brother is, at least, three, three times her size.

Thank you Manzella FamilyThe Manzella family, owner of 123 Shoes in Fairport, NY, held a fundraiser and brought in enough money to sponsor their SECOND life-saving transport! The lucky 17 saved on this trip from our friends at two shelters in Virginia and West Virginia! To the Manzella Family we just want to say ONE....TWO.... and... THREE Thank You(s)!!!   Mercy (the mom) was born about January 19, 2016 and weighs about 22 lbs. Joyful had mercy on her and her two surviving babies (Pasha & Keana) and brought them north even knowing the ride would be hard on them, but after what they'd been through we couldn't leave them at the shelter to die. We had to try. With a big enough crate, near the heat vent, for the family of three and some food and water they survived and have flourished! Even though we are helping these two southern shelters routinely they are still running full and are trying so very hard to adopt what they have instead of killing them off to take in new dogs so they have created a waiting list.  Someone left a note saying they couldn't wait any longer on a box in the parking lot when the staff arrived to work finding Mercy, two pups that had frozen to death, and two more who were failing fast!  The staff acted quickly to warm and feed the babies and within a short time they did begin to nurse and haven't looked death in the eye since! They are social, fat, really funny little things and Mom is a pretty little brown girl that we have just no idea of breed so we've guessed as well as we can. As for what the Father may have been we have absolutely no clue so these pups are quite the surprise package. So, please don't adopt these pups if you want something specific such as breed or ultimate weight, don't let their cuteness get in the way of getting what you want/need. Humans throw away dogs because they get too big, seldom because they stay too small.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $350.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Zani's al fresco Summer Adoptions follow us on FB to find us this summer as we will try new locations to meet the needs of NYC and support the little stores:)     Sweet Cookie Dane! 2y 80lbs, slow intro to new dogs as she is afraid!:)  During SAFER Cookie came into the assessment room calm and relaxed, she was friendly and social towards the assessor with a slow approach. She allowed all handling items to be conducted without issue. Cookie was relaxed during the tag interaction, and during the resources portion of the assessment Cookie was easy to handle when engaged with the item. Cookie appears to be sociable, and did not display any behaviors concerns, so the department feels she can be suitable for an ""Average"" adopter.  Look: 2. Dog pulls out of Assessor's hands each time without settling during three repetitions. Sensitivity: 1. Dog stands still and accepts the touch, her eyes are averted, and her tail is in neutral position with relaxed body posture. Dog's mouth is likely closed for at least a portion of the assessment item. Tag: 1. Follows at end of leash, body soft. Squeeze 1 & 2: 1. Dog gently pulls back her paw. Toy: 1. Minimal interest in toy, dog smells, then turns away.  Dog-dog: When off leash with other dogs, Cookie approaches the gate with a tense, tucked body but does show interest. After the initial greeting, she was let in the pen and tolerated the helper dog's attention and loosens up as she explored the pens. At one point she was on top of the playground equipment and growled in the helper dog's direction as he approached her. It appeared that she was uncertain as to how to go down the stairs and may have been fearful of his proximity.

Thank You Anne's Friend !!!“This transport was funded in celebration of the life of Anne by one of her high school classmates in Wellsville. Anne was a Springer lover and a school psychologist in Rochester. Anne died a young, and tragic, death and her friends were kept from her bedside by family. The transport sponsor felt this was a wonderful way to honor Anne.”   Jessie was born about February 24, 2014 and weighs about 40 lbs. This guy is the HAPPIEST dog we've ever met!  Even the photo from the shelter has his stubbed tail wiggling so fast it's a blur. He wiggles and wiggles and we are SO happy that we were able to save him from death. He's wonderful with the other dogs and all of us, we can't imagine a problem with this boy except tiny kids may be a problem since he is so wiggly and he seems to be a rather busy boy so we are thinking another dog in his next life would just add to the fun!

Hi y'all! I am Kayla, a 40 lb southern girl searching for my forever home.  I just love to play! Balls…tugs…stuffed toys…bones…you name it and I’ll play with it! I like to play with people and other dogs too (but not cats). The truth is, I’ve spent some time being a momma and the ACDRA people who saved me say it’s my turn to play like a young pup! They are teaching me lots of great things so I try very hard to do everything they say. You see, I get rewards when I do great things! I’ve learned how to sit, stay, walk nicely on a leash, and greet people without jumping. Watch my adoption video if you want to see how much I’m learning! Did I mention how much I love to cuddle and be with people? Yeah, I’m a snuggly, loving kind of girl. I’m also really good in my crate and housebroken too! I’m 3 years old, spayed, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines and preventatives, so I’m all ready for my forever home. If you’re looking for a smart, quick learning, cuddly-snuggly girl, pick me!  Email hannah.case@gmail.com if you have any questions about me. I am currently in Perkasie, PA.

K-e-v-i-n! Beautiful, boisterous, affectionate, playful, well trained and eager to learn, our Kevin has everything an active family could want in a pet and once you meet him I guarantee you’ll want to make this adorable boy your Kevin as soon as possible! A playgroup Prince who loves to socialize, Kevin mingles and rough houses with other dogs like he was born to it. He did rumble through the fence at a fellow male and I have a sneaking suspicion he’s a ladies’ man who prefers his posse to be of the female persuasion, but when Kevin throws a party everyone is sure to get a tail-wagging welcome. He knows commands for ‘come’ and ‘sit’, licks treats softly from my hand and gives wonderful jumpy hugs too. Out on the street Kevin walks nicely in harness and takes care of his bathroom break promptly and while toys seem to hold little appeal in the yard, he’s thrilled to be given one to chew on once we return from the park. Kevin is polite going back into his kennel and eagerly chows down on a fresh bowl of food he finds there and it’s only once I turn to leave that his happy eyes turn sad and he cries for me to please please come back and play with him. Unconditional loyalty has a face and it’s black and white and sweet all over. Welcome handsome Kevin home today and get ready to enjoy a lifetime of funny, playful, snuggly love! 01/06/2016 BEHAVIOR EVALUATION – NH ONLYExam Type BEHAVIORKevin was a bit difficult to remove from his kennel showing teeth, growling. Once he was removed from his kennel he walks calmly on leash. Kevin doesn’t allow the assessor or the assistant to pet him. He became uncomfortable giving a low growl; expose his front teeth, with a fearful body language. The behavior team decided to skip the handling part of the assessment for safety reasons. During the resources Kevin was not interested in toys. The behavior department feels that he would do best if placed with a New Hope partner who can follow up on this behavior in a more stable environment and can provide any necessary behavior modification before placement into a permanent home. Toy 1: No interest. Playgroup Notes: When off leash with other dogs, Kevin engages in gentle, bouncy play with another playful female.

Pretty Cool Mix !!!Zarah was born about June 15, 2015 and weighs about 50 lbs. She is one happy little girl that was adopted by a 20 something young lady that worked and partied a bit too much to own a dog. So, someone took Zarah into their home so that they could find a new home for her and then decided she was better off here, getting spayed, and we could find her a forever home! She is just wonderful with the other dogs, very playful, happy. She is good on leash and great on her 2 hour car ride here. She will hang with you while you do your outside chores and she is a lap dog so if you like to keep your dogs on the floor this girl is not for you. Zarah has been wonderful with kids as young as 5. As for breed there is some pit, but she has whiskers!

04/02/2016	Duke of Earl - Miniature Pinscher (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Miniature Pinscher	Cuba, NY	Male	Young	"Posted Breed: Miniature Pinscher (short coat). My Beloved Human is VERY ill.Duke was born June 16, 2015 and weighs about 12 pounds. He is one of a litter of teen pups that came to us because the human who bred them and kept them is in stage 5 kidney disease. We were called by the ladies aide to help place the pups and parents now that the owner can no longer care for them and was concerned what would happen to them if authorities had to take her from her home. All of the dogs were cautious upon arrival and, by breed, they can use some warm up time with new humans, not the best breed choice for small children. I also want to caution that many of these small dogs need floor potty pads throughout life as they have trouble holding it long. He is wonderful with the other dogs.  All food in the house had run out three hours before one of our amazing volunteers drove to the home and lovingly removed the dogs. He has a wonderful appetite and will eat about anything. It seems his dog mother ""dropped him out of the cradle"" and he developed a limp shortly after. We had xrays done at Camp Road Veterinary Hospital, by Dr. Hite, and here are her findings: Grade 4 medial luxating patella. Vulgus deformity (medial rotation) of the proximal tibia, possible traumatic or congenital angular limb deformity. Unable to determine if ACL is intact. Corrective surgery including moving tibial tuberosity will be needed +/- ACL. From chronically holding it up, there is muscle contraction and skin tightening to not allow the leg to straighten.  We feel he has no pain if he doesn't use it and he only uses it for balance. We don't feel that it should be amputed, at least at this time. Corrective surgery would probably have to be done by a specialist, but he can live with this imperfection, not all of us are perfect.  Duke is looking for a wonderful forever home that would make her first human mother proud. He does love to cuddle.  Update from Foster Mom: I'm so happy to tell you more about Duke of Earl. Although we haven't been fostering Duke very long, from the minute he came into our home it was as if he'd lived here his whole life. We've found him to be 100% loving, happy, playful and very well-mannered. His fur is soft and lush, squishier than that of our own Miniature Pinschers, and he LOVES having someone hold him and pet him!  My husband and I have many of our own dogs, male/female, little/big, variety of breeds, and Duke has had absolutely ZERO issues with any of our dogs from the beginning. While our dogs are pretty easy going as a whole, they are not ""professionally"" trained. We have a blind dog and the majority of our dogs are senior citizens, but Duke does beautifully with all of them and learned quickly which members of our pack were prime for playmates and which preferred to be left alone. He's VERY smart!  Duke sure loves toys! Balls, stuffed toys, any toy will do, and he is technically still sort of a puppy so having lots of toys will help insure he chews on things he's approved to chew on!  We have a doggy door from our kitchen to our fenced back yard, and Duke has it mastered! He has not pottied in our home, but keep in mind that he DOES have the ability to get outside to relieve himself when he needs to. If you don't have a similar arrangement you'll need to take him out regularly to go. I also have not noticed him doing any marking in our home like some of our own do!  Duke sleeps in bed all night long with my husband and a bunch of other dogs and not a peep all night. We find him to be much quieter than most Min Pin's...ahhhh, so nice!  Yes, Duke has a bum back leg as described above. It does not appear to bother him at all, and we have witnessed him still toe touching to use for balance sometimes, so it is what it is. If at some point he needs to have it amputated, he will still thrive and never skip a beat! I've fostered several tri-pods and even helped through the rehab process and find them to be resilient!   Duke deserves a loving forever family of his own, and I know there's someone special out there who has a special place in their heart for a dog like Duke. He may never win the AKC show, but who really cares about those shows anyways? Not us! After all, we all have flaws. Some just aren't quite as visible as others. He's a wonderful little house guest and can stay as long as he needs to until just the right person comes along.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $100.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.   YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES    We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list.

04/02/2016	Lucy - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Garden City, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Hello My name is Lucy and I am a 12 week old cattle dog/lab mix.  Lucy is being fostered in Highland Lakes NJ. I am about 15 lbs and growing FAST! My foster mom says I'm going to be on the bigger size between 40-50 lbs she thinks. I am a super sweet girl once I get to know you. I really like to play with my foster siblings and would really like a playmate of my own. I am a shy girl at first with new people and if I have a confident friend with me I feel more secure. I really like treats though so if you have treats we can be friends too. Once I get to know you I'm a really sweet girl and love to play and cuddle. After running around the backyard with my foster siblings I like to cuddle up with foster mom and take a nap. I also really like my bed to sleep in after playtime. My crate is ok and if foster mom wants me to go in I have to get a treat so I know that is what she wants me to do. I am also very smart and am learning sit. I think I would like agility and it would boost my confidence. I am a fast dog and like to do zoomies around the backyard. I am working on potty training and am getting better at it. Its something that I have some trouble with but starting to get the hang of it. I am also learning to walk on a leash. Its fun to take walks around the neighborhood and I'm learning not to pull. I have never met kids in my foster home but I am a shy girl so younger kids may scare me. I would have to met them before to make sure I like them. I do live with dog savvy cats and they are fine. I do like to chase them if my foster siblings do. I'm going to go back and play now. Foster mom can tell you the rest about me. Lucy loves to run around in the backyard so either a physical fence is required or a dog park near by that she can go to frequently. She also needs to go to a home with another confident dog. She loves having a playmate and it helps her when she is around new people. Lucy takes sometime to warm up, a few hours to a day, but once she does she is glued to you. She is current on all her puppy vaccines and is on heart worm and flea and tick prevention. Lucy is currently being fostered in Highland Lakes, NJ.  Questions? Please contact brizzy16@yahoo.com.

Great with other dogs, this precious pup would flourish in a home with other animals; sweet and cuddly, Please note this little sweetheart is DEAF and will need an adopter who is willing to make the commitement it takes to train a deaf dog. It is a serious commitment but one of the most rewarding things you can do! Winnie is ready for a forever home that will give her the love she most definitely deserves!Winnie is a 10-11 month old terrier mix found wandering the streets of Alabama all by her lonesome. What was worse is that she was hit by a car. While there wasn't too much damage done, she had to have her tail amputated because it was destoyed on impact. No one would know, however, because Winnie is as sweet, loving and trusting as any pup out there.She's just a good natured girl. Winnie is only approxmiately 25-30 lbs and we don't expect she'll grow much more! She's likely to be a perma-puppy - she'll always look like a baby! She needs a forever home desperately, and will make the perfect companion. This dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.

04/02/2016	Buttercup - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Fairport, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Buttercup is really not the wild and crazy girl she appears to be in her face picture. She does have very striking eyes that are more pronounced because of the tan markings around them. She has a a coat that is primarily white, a good lean build, weighing a trim 56 pounds. She takes treats nicely, enjoys some back scratching and chin and ear rubs. Her leash walking skills need some help, but with more practice she will catch on to that. She is working on sitting quietly in her kennel before going on walks, and is a real sweetie. Lollypop Farm suggests that children in the home be at least 14 years old. Buttercup was found as a stray, so we have no history on her. She also would be happiest if she could be the only dog in your home. She and her new owner will be required to attend training classes. Buttercup needs to learn impulse control, and basic dog skills. There is a discount on the first six week session if the classes are taken through Lollypop Farm.

04/02/2016	Edgar - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Lockport, NY	Male	Baby	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Hi, my name WAS Pinky. I was found as a stray and am about 2-3 yo. I am an American bulldog/Pitty mix. I currently reside in a shelter where they love me but I've heard once they get full, they will need the kennel I am occupying. If no one steps up for me, I think we all know what that means. A few DITR volunteers have fallen in love with me and have visited me. They said I was so handsome and such a sweetheart. They could tell I craved human attention and kept hugg ing and kissing me. I loved every minute of it.   They brought dogs to play with me to see how I would do. I aced it! I loved playing and if anyone got snarky with me, I took the cue and walked away. I heard them say they wanted to see how I would do with cats someday. DITR committed to me and renamed me Edgar. Now I just need a place to go. And probably soon before my shelter gets full. All of us- especially me are looking for a foster or an adopter for me. I promise to be loyal and love you. I am a good boy. Please consider me - you will not be disappointed. Love, Edgar      Edgar is currently living in a shelter home while we try to set him up with a foster home or adoptor. (3/23/16)  Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, Microchipping and deworming and flea treatment.

My name is SPARTY aka SPARTACUS and I'm a handsome 3 yr M Blk/White Amstaff/Blk Lab X. I'm 70 lbs of PURE SWEET BOY!. I was rescued in the nick of time from death row and I'm just a BIG LOVE. I am a playful, friendly, loving and medium active boy and am an expert fetcher. I pull a bit on the leash so I could use more leash training but I know basic commands like Sit and Stop. My foster has 2 young kids and I'm good with them as long as they are quiet and calm, but if they get me too excited then I get the zoomies and can knock them down; but I don't mean to, it's just that I'm so big and clumsy. I am good with dogs in passing and would probably love to play with a large female dog and was fine with the neighbor's pug. I don't like cats unfortunately. I love to go for walks or run loose in a fenced in yard but when I'm inside, my favorite thing to do is lounge on the couch or my doggie bed and roll over for belly rubs. If you want a BIG GOOFY LUG to be your BFF please come meet/adopt me today!! For more info/app; pls email your ph# to : CECE@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG

Thank You Orchard Park Team!!!! What amazing volunteers we have! Just a few weeks ago, our volunteers at Orchard Park PetSmart sponsored their first transport and brought in the ""BUFFALO"" dogs. They decided once is just not enough, and already raised enough money to sponsor a second transport to save more lives! On top of that, they're doing an amazing job of finding them homes once we get them up here! What we do takes teamwork, and huge thanks to our Orchard Park volunteers for being part of our team!    Brian was born about January 9, 2016 and we are guessing these pups will weigh in the 35 - 50 lb. range but we are sincerely guessing on breed and ultimate weight so if you don't like surprises this puppy is not for you. These pups are SO social, friendly, happy, well-adjusted and PLAYFUL!  We have no clue of what either parent was. These pups were dropped off at the shelter and no information was given, but they don't care, they are just HAPPY! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $375.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Please contact Debbie (resqmom54@icloud.com) for more information about this pet.Are you looking for love this Spring? Joey is the boy for you! Joey is a 1 year old pom that weighs about 8 pounds!  Joey has lots of energy and loves to play! But what did you expect? He is still very much a puppy! His foster mom likes to watch him zoom around the yard with the other dogs - she says he's the cutest of all! Joey would love another small, playful dog in the house to keep him busy and happy. He walks nicely on a leash but a fenced yard would be nice so he can burn off some of that energy! He's smart as a whip but some puppy charm school would make him practically perfect. Joey is good with kids, other small dogs and had no issues with cats. He is crate trained and house training is coming along nicely for this young fellow! Joey is neutered, UTD with vaccines, microchipped, heartworm tested neg, flea/worm treated. Joey did have a fractured leg when he was very young but it has been xrayed and there are no issues with it now. His adoption donation is $325 - please apply on the Pixie Mamas website if you are interested in adopting this handsome pup!

04/02/2016	Brennan Chimera - Chihuahua (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chihuahua	Cuba, NY	Male	Young	"Posted Breed: Chihuahua (short coat). I'm From The Chimera Transport!The Chimera transport is named in memory of three amazing women in my family? Mary Ann (mom), Barbara (aunt), and Clara (grandmother). They all raised me and sacrificed much to give me a chance in this world. The reason I choose to sponsor Southern transports is to give a chance to the ""underdog"". Homeless dogs and cats from the south often have the odds against them to live a happy, long life with a family to call their own. Every week we read about the stories and see the pictures of those lucky animals who make it up north. It is magical how a little four legged friend can bring joy and companionship into a home. They also know they hit the lucky Joyful Rescues jackpot! When I look into the eyes of my little southern rescue Piper, I can see pure joy and love. Being able to share that gift with other deserving families brings me great happiness. Every animal deserves to be loved and cared for. these transports give that chance to many luck passengers! ~ Michelle Alessi   Brannan was born about March 16, 2015 and weighs about 5 lbs. He is a teeny, tiny, package of love and sweetness!!!  No information comes from the dogs in the south, but we are going to guess that he is going to struggle with house training as so many of these tiny dogs do and he may struggle throughout life causing you to want to have potty floor pads handy for those times he just can't hold it. He is wonderful with other dogs and that is about all we know so far. We sure are glad he make the trip! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $350.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Mac came to us as an owner surrender. Mac is a very typical English Bulldog! He is sweet and loving, very affectionate to people and always wants attention and love! He is the most kissy bulldog ever! He loves to play - he can be very silly too! He is also strong & stubborn! He is leash trained, crate trained and house trained. Please expect accidents as he adjusts though. Mac is fine with kids as long as they are a bit older and sturdier. No issues with cats.

Mac should be with someone who has Bulldog experience and knows their ways and quirks  Mac came to us with skin and ear issues due to food allergies. He has improved greatly but his new home must continue a strict grain free diet to ensure his good health! He rides very well in the car and likes to do errands around town with his foster mom!

04/02/2016	Emma Manzella - Dachshund (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund	Cuba, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Dachshund (long coat). Thank you Manzella Family!The Manzella family, owner of 123 Shoes in Fairport, NY, held a fundraiser that brought in enough money to sponsor their SECOND life-saving transport! The lucky 17 saved on this trip from our friends at two shelters in Virginia and West Virginia! To the Manzella Family we just want to say ONE....TWO.... and... THREE Thank You(s)!!!   Emma was born about May 14, 2014 and weighs about 10 lbs. Emma's human Dad heard we were coming down and met us to tearfully relinquish Emma to us with deep regret. He ADORED this girl, but there was a wife and child involved and Emma was not good with the child. Emma also has issues with some other dogs (we are finding her doing very well with the other dogs in her foster home) and anyone she doesn't know well. Still reading??? She is still young and playful, chases shadows, and can be a chewer. She'd like to be the dominant being in the home so we are looking for dog savvy humans who won't let her get away with it and she guards food and toys. Emma does prefer someone that is home much of the time (but does fairly well with crating). Like so many of these tiny dogs she can struggle with house training and potty floor pads are probably in her future. Still reading??? So, let's go over her good points! We all know that no one is perfect....  She is good on leash and enjoys car rides. We truly feel Emma needs a fenced yard so that no one is ever in danger of being bit, which she has not accomplished in life yet, but there have been close calls. The loves running around outside and inside and then she'll be ready to join you for snuggle time and a good belly rub. She also loves bath time and it's a good thing she's absolutely drop dead (which could have happened if she had ended up at another shelter) GORGEOUS!!!!  All of the above information was from her human Dad, but now we'll tell you what we've seen in only 1 week with us. We saw a lot of teeth at first, but a few treats and a little coaxing later she was in the arms of one of the female staff, shortly after that our male staff member had her walking on leash and picking her up to be carried, then she decided she loved another and another of us so we, truly, feel we are going to be able to find her the perfect home out there and someone is going to love her to pieces!  Doxies tend to have an aggressive streak so this isn't all that uncommon. Emma is doing very well in her foster home. She adores her humans and enjoys playing with the smaller dogs in the house. Emma loves to play with stuffed toys and certainly knows what treats are all about! She uses potty pads in the house, but has been out the doggy door also. She is a real snuggler, especially with her human dad.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $225.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet.

Manhattan CenterMy name is QUEEN and I am a NYC ACC death row survivor. Furbridge saved me and now it's your turn to help! Queen is in need of a new foster or an adopter.

She will shower you with love, loyalty, companionship and gratitude. Please consider Queen as she is not doing well in her current foster home - she does not get along with their cats and is therefore by herself a lot and this is overly stressful for her. Queen is a wonderful loving dog that more than deserves a chance at a 2nd beginning. Please consider Queen. I promise yoiu, you won't regret it!!!To foster or adopt, please fill out an application at http://beta.petstablished.com/adoption_form/1946/generic

Shoshana was found as a stray in someone's yard on Long Island. She is a precious 9 pound, 14 year-old little girl who is shy at first but friendly and enjoys affection. Shoshana is a curious gal, and loves exploring and smelling new things and new people. She knows there's a lot of world she hasn't seen yet, and she can't wait to experience it. She's great with dogs, and enjoys hanging out with her bouncy foster brother. She may be an older gal, but she loves checking out new places.Shoshana is a fantastic apartment dog, she's very quiet, even when the dog across the halll tries to rile her up by barking, she either ignores him, or gives her foster mom a look as if to say ""can you beleive him?!"" Shoshana hasn't had the life she deserves, and can be a little shy, but once she trusts you she loves to be near people and get pet or scratched (especially behind the ears). Will you save Shoshana and let her spend her golden years with a family of her own?This dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.

04/02/2016	Mr. Scruffles - Shih Tzu / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Shih Tzu-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: Shih Tzu / Mixed (short coat). We were absolutely horrified when we were alerted to a dog who had been abused and left to die in a cardboard box along side a busy road in Long Island NY. Thankfully Second Chance Rescue NYC stepped up to save this poor baby. They named him Scruffles. He is a mid-aged shih-tzu, who is not only deformed on his front legs, he is suffering terribly from demodex mange, dry eye, and his fur was terribly matted and filled with feces and urine. To think of the suffering that this little boy must have endured day after day, is disturbing. Doctors are not certain if his deformed legs are due to human abuse or if he was kept in a small crate for a long period of time which could have caused the deformity. Our hearts are broken for him, and we can not understand how anyone could leave this helpless boy on the side of a very busy road in a box to die. SCR will do everything to make his heart and body whole again. They have rushed Scruffles to the emergency vet this morning, where he will be treated and assessed. They will give him top notch medical care, and have his legs examined by an orthopedic specialist. Scruffles has a long road ahead of him, but we are here for the long haul, and we will see it through. Will you help us? Please consider purchasing an item above to help us raise the funds needed for his care!

Please contact Debbie (resqmom54@icloud.com) for more information about this pet. Simon is a 1-year-old, 10 lb. Maltese. He was rescued from a puppy mill recently and we are grateful that he was one of the lucky ones to get out at a young age!    Simon is adjusting to living in a house with people who are nice to him, having a fenced yard to run and play with his foster siblings, getting lots of good food, clean water, sunshine and fresh air. Life is a real adventure now that he’s not locked up in a wire crate 24/7! Simon had to have his entire coat shaved down since he was so matted and filthy. He will have a beautiful coat of long white hair in a few short months. Simon is extremely playful, social, and quite the lover boy. Give him a lap to sit in and someone to cuddle with, and this little boy is a love bug. He would love another dog for a buddy, a fenced yard is a must as he is still learning how to walk on a leash and children over 7 years. House-training is moving forward and he is learning how to live in a house.   Simon is now neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, heartworm tested neg, flea/worm treated. He has also been groomed! Simon’s adoption donation is $325. If you have the necessary criteria, you may be having a new little guy snuggled on your couch very soon – just in time for Spring!

She was emaciated, dehydrated, sitting in her own feces and urine soaked crate for weeks. We took Nala into our Rescue where she received medical care and restored health. She then went on to find a home where she has been living. We received some news that Nala would need to come back to us. ... Her world pretty much is turned upside down again. The family is splitting up and moving away. This personal issue is going to impact Nala's home situation. A very sad situation for this sweet girl, so we are going to tell you about Nala and hope her life will get right back on track with a forever home or foster family who will welcome her as soon as possible.

Nala is 18 months old will be 2 in July. Nala will be crushed loosing her family a second time. We don't want her to feel anything but loved, secure and have a loving home.

I'm From The Chimera Transport!The Chimera transport is named in memory of three amazing women in my family? Mary Ann (mom), Barbara (aunt), and Clara (grandmother). They all raised me and sacrificed much to give me a chance in this world. The reason I choose to sponsor Southern transports is to give a chance to the ""underdog"". Homeless dogs and cats from the south often have the odds against them to live a happy, long life with a family to call their own. Every week we read about the stories and see the pictures of those lucky animals who make it up north. It is magical how a little four legged friend can bring joy and companionship into a home. They also know they hit the lucky Joyful Rescues jackpot! When I look into the eyes of my little southern rescue Piper, I can see pure joy and love. Being able to share that gift with other deserving families brings me great happiness. Every animal deserves to be loved and cared for. these transports give that chance to many luck passengers! ~ Michelle Alessi   Blair was born about December 16, 2013 and weighs about 8 lbs. She is a teeny, tiny, package of love and sweetness once she gets to know you. She is going to need some gentle warm up time and is typical Chihuahua nippy unless she knows you.  No information comes from the dogs in the south, but we are going to guess that she is going to struggle with house training as so many of these tiny dogs do and he may struggle throughout life causing you to want to have potty floor pads handy for those times she just can't hold it. She is wonderful with other dogs and that is about all we know so far. We sure are glad she make the trip! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $250.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Hi my name is Valentine, it hasn't always been though. You see, someone threw me over a fence because they didn't want me anymore. I was sad, scared and my feelings hurt but then someone came to save me. They couldn't believe their eyes when they came to investigate what had been thrown over their fence! They thought it was a plastic bag but instead they found a puppy - they found ME! My Good Samaritans were frantic and couldn't believe anyone could be so heartless. Although their circumstances didn't allow for them to keep me, they knew they wanted to help. They started making phone calls and Furbridge heard their cry for help and now I am getting lots of love, plenty of food and a warm bed.  Everyone that meets me wants me as I am quiet and sweet, timid even when you first meet me. I may be a girl, but I can hold my own, even with the big dogs.

Belasario was born about January 27, 2016 and ""may"" end up weighing in the 50 lb. range like mom, our Yeti, but we have no idea what dad was so these pups may be a surprise package. Please don't let the cuteness get in the way and be sure you are OK with the ultimate outcome of these babies. We don't want our dogs thrown away because they get too big. Thank you.  This transport is in honor and loving memory of our nephew, Patrick James Paladino, who passed away suddenly at the young age of 29. He was a devilish sort of boy, with a smile that would take your breath away and one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen. His sidekick and best friend, Duke, an American Staffordshire Bulldog, went everywhere with Patrick and the bond they shared was incredible. Duke now can be see everywhere with Patrick's father, Carl and is a permanent fixture on any of the couches in the Ellicott Square offices.  Many years ago a small, white dog ""supposedly"" followed Pat home from school. He begged his mother to let him keep him; she did. He named him Buttons and had him for years. This is one of my favorite stories about Pat, as I feel he rescued this dog long before Animal Rescues ever existed.  Joe and I chose rescue as our way to honor Patrick.  We can see him smiling as this wonderful rescue is about to take place in his name. We also felt we wanted to mention the three humans whose lives were also saved due to his parents selfless act of choosing organ donation.   Patrick, your nieces and nephews are very excited about this and have already picked out names. So let this journey begin and load up this truck, with your spirit protecting and guiding our precious transporters to where the once abandoned and abused will be rescued and cared for, until that special soul comes along that will give them their second chance at life, their forever home and most of all, love, just like you did that day you rescued Buttons so many years ago. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $400.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet.

Thank You Orchard Park Team!!!! What amazing volunteers we have! Just a few weeks ago, our volunteers at Orchard Park PetSmart sponsored their first transport and brought in the ""BUFFALO"" dogs. They decided once is just not enough, and already raised enough money to sponsor a second transport to save more lives! On top of that, they're doing an amazing job of finding them homes once we get them up here! What we do takes teamwork, and huge thanks to our Orchard Park volunteers for being part of our team!    Judy was born about March 16, 2013 and weighs about 10 lbs. She came to us a matted, scared to death, mess of fur with her eyes barely able to see out of the mats. She truly needs another dog in her next life that will be her bff and show her that the world is not so scary. She is going to need house training and we have good tips for you to get this process started, but we also want to warn that sometimes these tiny dogs need potty floor pads handy when they just can't hold it any longer. There is a link on our website about working with fearful, and puppy mill dogs, and we highly suggest you read it over if you are considering adopting Judy. Judy is doing extremely well in her foster home. She absolutely loves her humans and gets along well with the other dogs in the house. She is successfully using potty pads. She is slowly learning about toys, but learned quickly about treats! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $300.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Please note that we can not guarantee the age or breed of any animal. What we provide is our best estimates based on our experience and the information provided by the our medical partners.Approx. 7-8 year old Retriever/Corgi Dog Mix Male    This little guy has a sad story...   Heres when we first rescued them:   3 dogs living their lives on the end of chains. They are rarely fed or given water. They are covered in fleas and ticks and haven't any shelter from the elements. Despite their situation they are still very sweet. They don't even have each other for comfort as their chains limit them from interactin g with one another. One is chained to the fence and can't even reach a dog house, he is just left out in the weather.   Originally there were 7 dogs, the others have died already. One hanged himself with his chain. These babies really deserve a family that will love them and take care of them. Everytime it rains or is cold it is a wonder if they will make it through another day.   This is how a neighbor described the situation when asking for assistance. The owner is willing to give them up to anyone who is interested in taking them. We know that they have not been given regular medical care, they are likely heartworm positive, they may have lyme's disease or other tick borne illnesses but we know one thing is for sure, with your help their lives will be forever changed for the better.    Now Bubba is ready to find a forever home. He is good with other dogs and cats, and is approx. 7-8 years old. Bubba is also house broken. When he arrived to NY and attended the same event as one of the dogs he was rescued with, it was clear there was a bond that we could not break between them. Therefore, we are looking for a home for Bubba and his friend Betsy where they can spend the rest of their lives, together.  Please help us find them a home!      At the time of adoption a donation of $250 (dogs over 6 months) and $350 (dogs 6 months and under) is requested before the animal is placed in a new home.         *IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ANIMAL, PLEASE SUBMIT  AN ADOPTION APPLICATION  AND ONCE APPROVED, SOMEONE FROM THIS ORGANIZATION WILL CONTACT YOU.

Ridge likes to play with both males and females, he does well with all dogs. He is up to date on shots and will be neutered prior to adoption. We do not know how he does with cats at this time. If you would like to adopt him, please apply here!                
03/29/2016	Buttercup - Chocolate Labrador Retriever (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	New York, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Chocolate Labrador Retriever (short coat). Buttercup is a 1 year old female chocolate lab who was found so emaciated she could not stand on her own. It was touch and go for awhile but she is now at the point where she is ready to look for her forever home! She is up to date on shots, and good with all people and other dogs, cats are an unknown. Buttercup loves to show off and gets excited at play time in the yard. She would make an excellent hiking, walking or running partner! She loves kids, and would benefit in a home with kids to play with as she does love playing fetch and play time in the yard! She gobbles her food down, as she had been quite starved when found...this should get better over time. Her southern foster has been working with her on house training to potty outside, so she might have a few accidents while she continues her training with you. Buttercup is a social gal who wants to meet everyone she sees, and who really likes to be around her people. Apply to adopt this perfect gal!                
03/29/2016	Lila - Yorkshire Terrier Yorkie (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Cuba, NY	Female	Adult	"Posted Breed: Yorkshire Terrier Yorkie (long coat). Just Released From a Puppy Mill!Lila was born about ____ and weighs about 10 lbs. She is just adorable and was wonderful while we were handling her for vaccines and photos. Although this girl has lived her life in a cage birthing puppies for pet store shelves she is quite social and we feel she should turn around nicely and begin acting more like a normal dog, who had a normal life, in the near future. She will need house training as she has been in a cage 24/7 eating,sleeping, and going potty with the bottom of the cage being wire so the waste falls through to a tray. We have a lot of good information on our main website to help you with turning around a mill dog. Please do a little reading before applying for this cutie as she will be a project for awhile and your response to her behavior is key in the speed at which she recovers from her past. She is wonderful with other dogs and most mill dogs do better with another normal dog in the house showing them the ropes! A mill dog can be a bit of work, but the moment that you see the look of love in their eyes it is the most rewarding feeling in the world!!!!  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $375.00.

In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet.

03/29/2016	Claire - Shepherd / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Perry, NY	Female	Baby	"Posted Breed: Shepherd / Mixed (short coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Claire is your typical playful puppy. She's working hard on learning to go potty outside. She is very smart and knows she gets a treat when she's done. She's sleeping through the night and waking to a dry crate. When she needs a break from playing she'll go in her crate all on her own to rest. Claire loves food so the food supply will need to be kept tightly out of reach or she will break into it. She has no qualms about putting her head in her foster siblings bowls and being nice, however she is protective of her own bowl so we encourage supervised feedings if other dogs are in the household. Claire is very cuddly and loves to play. She loves her stuffed babies and hops like a little goat when she's happy or excited. She'll very appreciative if you provide her with lots of bones, as these are her absolute favorites when it comes to chewing. Claire has been working on walking on a leash. Good manners will be very important as she's likely to be a big girl. Claire will be a wonderful family member. Are you Claire's forever home? Her adoption fee is $300 which covers all of the above medical care such as spay, vaccines, dewormers, and microchipAdoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

She loves all people and dogs. She is so excited to see other dogs, she may be a little too much at first but she is completely harmless. Asia loves to chew on hard toys such as kongs would be best. She is crate trained and needs to be in a crate anytime you plan on leaving her home alone. As a dog that was living on a chain outside, she is getting better with her house manners but still needs some work. She has learned how to sit and stay however if she's too excited she may not listen. She would do best with a famil;y that can give her tons of exercise and structure. Asia goes to the bathroom outside and has only had a few accidents in the house. On a leash she can pull but I've seen a huge change lately. She has also been off the leash and comes right back when you call her. Asia has never been properly to cats so I cant say for sure how she will do.

Every week the volunteers put a dollar or two into their red jar and when the total reaches $500.00 they cheer because they can sponsor another transport to bring dogs out of high kill shelters in the south to Joyful Rescues where they will find their forever homes.    Hats off to all these wonderful humans.   If you look up the definition of “love”, all their names would show up!    Carrie was born about February 6, 2015 and weighs about 35 lbs. She is cute as a button and ultimately friendly and happy! We have discovered one thing about her that you need to know. Our kennels have ladder like rungs and she easily climbs to 6 foot on them If your yard is fenced a wooden fence or electric fence should be oOK but maybe not chain link just for precaution.   No information is gathered when humans dump their dogs off at a high kill pound as the staff knows they are probably going to die and it's not worth the time and energy to interview the owners. Please understand that Joyful and our vets are doing the best we can to guess age, breed, and ultimate weight, but if you are looking for something exact and don't like surprises you may be served better with another shelter.

What we provide is our best estimates based on our experience and the information provided by the our medical partners.Approx. 1 year old Pointer/Terrier Mix Female  This is Rosie and she has an interesting story. One of our volunteers friends goes to college in Florida and decided to rescue a dog from craigslist with her roomate. They named her Rosie and Rosie was being given away for free. If they didn't get her, who knows what could've happened to her. Well it turns out that they weren't allowed to house Rosie and she had to find other living arrangements. Between the rescuers friend taking her in and letting her live in their appartment to moving to a local foster home of a fellow animal lover, Rosie only had a stable spot in NY, back with the rescuers family. Rosie flew to NY and is now in foster care on Long Island. She is great with dogs of all sizes but is too interested in cats. She likes to chase them and get in their face. Not sure if she'd be best in a home with a feline friend, but would love a doggie friend who she could run around with to get her puppy energy out! She loves to cuddle, run, play, and give kisses! She definitely needs a place where she can get her energy out, but also a place with someone to snuggle with at the end of the day. Rosie is housebroken and crate trained and ready to find her forever home!

03/29/2016	Sammy (Beagle) - Beagle / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Beagle / Mixed (short coat). This is Sammy, He is really a great dog. I know because I go see him at boarding I am a volunteer with SCR. Sammy stayed at my house so he wouldn't be alone the past two nights. He gets scared with the barking at boarding. He goes in a corner and shakes at times. Everyone at boarding does what they can to make him feel safe and loved, But at the end of the day he sleeps all by himself. He is very friendly, did really well with my dogs ... . He gets very attached to you. Doesn't like being in a crate and has some separation anxiety. Can you blame him though? Every time he thinks he has a family someone leaves him. He loves the yard. He sleeps through the night on a doggie bed. He does jump over gates in my house but its not to wonder off and make trouble. He just wants to be where you are. He takes treats very gently and will sit for you even before you reward him. He was a little shy when he met my husband but within seconds he was wagging his tail and was acting like he lived in our home his entire life. He walks great on a leash. NO pulling at all. Sammy's visit was over this morning and he went back to boarding today cry emoticon He needs a foster family or better yet a forever home. I am at my legal limit with pets so Sammy can't live with me. BUT he can live with a loving family who is willing to give him a home. He needs the offers. Please consider this very very sweet boy. He doesn't deserve this. Sammy is a beagle/mix 3.5 years old. Neutered and up to date on his vetting. Good with DOGS will do well with CATS and CHILDREN. http://www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/app-form/

03/29/2016	Lacy Rochester - Collie / Beagle / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle-Collie Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Adult	"Posted Breed: Collie / Beagle / Mixed (medium coat). Thank You Rochester Team! Every Saturday, whether rain, sleet, snow or sunshine, Joyful Rescues' dynamic team of volunteers on our Rochester team show up at Webster PetSmart doing everything they can to help homeless dogs and cats find a ""forever home"" and get a second chance for a life full of love and happiness. Their dedication and commitment to animal rescue doesn't end with giving their time....something most of us feel we never have enough of. They also coordinate many fundraisers, special adoption showings, present educational programs, foster dogs in their homes, lobby in Albany against puppy mills, gather donations from the community to meet our needs, distribute donation jars to businesses in their area and collect the money from them monthly, make beautiful handmade merchandise for pets and pet lovers to sell at craft events, turn in bottles and cans and send the refunded deposits to Joyful Rescues, and the list goes on. Yet they always look for ways to do MORE! Well, they've just done MORE! They decided to pitch in whatever they could until they came up with enough money to sponsor their own life saving transport...$500.00... and they did it! Thank you to our amazing Rochester volunteer team! You've all found yet another way to make a world of difference for the homeless pets in need. Lacy was born about December 11, 2007 and weighs about 35 lbs. She is an adorable, rather, fluffy girl that is wonderful with all of us humans but we feel she would rather be the only dog in the home. She is nicely house trained and crate trained and is not a noisy girl which we love here. She is going to be a devoted companion for someone looking for love! Lacy did well during our cat test and she's been excellent with children as young as two. She is fine on leash, but hesitant about new situations. Lacy is fine in the car. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $150.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

We have a special boy in search of a new foster...or better yet, an adopter. Captain Wink will be celebrating his first birthday on February 2nd and for such a little guy (38 pounds) there is a lot to know about Captain! Captain has a relatively rare skin condition called non epidermolytic ichthyosis. It causes flaky skin, and hair loss. The treatment consists of an oral anti-fungal medication that he takes daily, and medicated baths 2 to 3 times per week.  Fortunately, he is cooperative with his baths, and is mostly interested in trying to drink the water! Captain takes oral thyroid medication twice daily for his low thyroid levels. He also has low vision; one of his eyes did not develop properly.  Captain eats a limited-ingredient dog food twice daily. He gets fish oil on his food as a supplement, as well as a vitamin/mineral supplement with his food. Because of his thyroid condition, Captain drinks ALOT and of course has to go potty frequently.  Since baths are a big part of Captain's life, someone with a good grooming/bathing set up would be idea, as well as someone who is home most of the time or able to give him access to go potty often.  Captain is a sweet and gentle boy. He is good with people and other dogs, but because his skin is fragile, he should not live with high-energy dogs who enjoy wrestling or other rough play. As you can see, Captain Wink is still a baby, who has given a rough deal in life with his medical conditions, but he is truly worth the time and effort to keep him happy. He needs a special, dedicated FOSTER or FOREVER home  All of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary. Vet references are required and prior to adoption a home inspection will be conducted.   Transport options available. Adoption fee applies.

Just Released From a Puppy Mill!Lila was born about ____ and weighs about 10 lbs. She is just adorable and was wonderful while we were handling her for vaccines and photos. Although this girl has lived her life in a cage birthing puppies for pet store shelves she is quite social and we feel she should turn around nicely and begin acting more like a normal dog, who had a normal life, in the near future. She will need house training as she has been in a cage 24/7 eating,sleeping, and going potty with the bottom of the cage being wire so the waste falls through to a tray. We have a lot of good information on our main website to help you with turning around a mill dog. Please do a little reading before applying for this cutie as she will be a project for awhile and your response to her behavior is key in the speed at which she recovers from her past.

Please note that we can not guarantee the age or breed of any animal. What we provide is our best estimates based on our experience and the information provided by the our medical partners.Approx. 7-8 year old Retriever/Corgi Dog Mix Male    This little guy has a sad story...   Heres when we first rescued them:   3 dogs living their lives on the end of chains. They are rarely fed or given water. They are covered in fleas and ticks and haven't any shelter from the elements. Despite their situation they are still very sweet. They don't even have each other for comfort as their chains limit them from interactin g with one another. One is chained to the fence and can't even reach a dog house, he is just left out in the weather.   Originally there were 7 dogs, the others have died already. One hanged himself with his chain. These babies really deserve a family that will love them and take care of them. Everytime it rains or is cold it is a wonder if they will make it through another day.   This is how a neighbor described the situation when asking for assistance. The owner is willing to give them up to anyone who is interested in taking them. We know that they have not been given regular medical care, they are likely heartworm positive, they may have lyme's disease or other tick borne illnesses but we know one thing is for sure, with your help their lives will be forever changed for the better.    Now Bubba is ready to find a forever home. He is good with other dogs and cats, and is approx. 7-8 years old. Bubba is also house broken. When he arrived to NY and attended the same event as one of the dogs he was rescued with, it was clear there was a bond that we could not break between them. Therefore, we are looking for a home for Bubba and his friend Betsy where they can spend the rest of their lives, together.  Please help us find them a home!

In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Claire is your typical playful puppy. She's working hard on learning to go potty outside. She is very smart and knows she gets a treat when she's done. She's sleeping through the night and waking to a dry crate. When she needs a break from playing she'll go in her crate all on her own to rest. Claire loves food so the food supply will need to be kept tightly out of reach or she will break into it. She has no qualms about putting her head in her foster siblings bowls and being nice, however she is protective of her own bowl so we encourage supervised feedings if other dogs are in the household. Claire is very cuddly and loves to play. She loves her stuffed babies and hops like a little goat when she's happy or excited. She'll very appreciative if you provide her with lots of bones, as these are her absolute favorites when it comes to chewing. Claire has been working on walking on a leash. Good manners will be very important as she's likely to be a big girl. Claire will be a wonderful family member. Are you Claire's forever home? Her adoption fee is $300 which covers all of the above medical care such as spay, vaccines, dewormers, and microchipAdoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

She loves all people and dogs. She is so excited to see other dogs, she may be a little too much at first but she is completely harmless. Asia loves to chew on hard toys such as kongs would be best. She is crate trained and needs to be in a crate anytime you plan on leaving her home alone. As a dog that was living on a chain outside, she is getting better with her house manners but still needs some work. She has learned how to sit and stay however if she's too excited she may not listen. She would do best with a famil;y that can give her tons of exercise and structure. Asia goes to the bathroom outside and has only had a few accidents in the house. On a leash she can pull but I've seen a huge change lately. She has also been off the leash and comes right back when you call her. Asia has never been properly to cats so I cant say for sure how she will do.

03/29/2016	SWEETIE - Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Southampton, NY	Female	Baby	"Posted Breed: Terrier / Mixed. Please note that we can not guarantee the age or breed of any animal. What we provide is our best estimates based on our experience and the information provided by the our medical partners.Approx. 12 year old Terrier Mix Female  Foster Update: Spike & Sweetie are a bonded pair who joined our ""pack"" 2 weeks ago. Spike is 5 years old and just a big love bug. He just wants to be wherever you are. Sweetie is 12 years old and her name says it all. Both really love being outside. Spike enjoys playing balls. They came from a home with children and get along well with other dogs. Spike gives Sweetie love and goes over to her and licks her....it's pretty great to watch. These 2 would make a great addition to any home!!!     A volunteer writes:   Sweetie spells Family Dog…..Twelve years of age, in mint condition, precious looking, well mannered, low key, friendly, obedient, a great walker and housetrained…Her former owner had only good things to say about her and housemate Spike, her best and younger friend, also relinquished to us …Sweetie lived in harmony with very young children , was welcoming of strangers, very playful , affectionate and free of any handling issues. She is truly a very pretty and feminine gal who face almost looks painted. She is the right weight and so perfectly groomed. Even in an unfamiliar environment, Sweetie is composed and behaves like a house dog. After a little exploration in the yard, she comes without asking to sit by my side, glancing frequently at me like for approval. She climbs stairs gingerly and walks beautifully on the leash, tail wagging, clearly enjoying her stroll in the night. I forgot to say that she is very much housetrained as related to us by her owner. What’s not to love about Sweetie? She is a real rose, a lovely flower to cherish… Let’s hope that a brighter light soon shines on her and leads her to a home sweet home and a loving family.   Another Volunteer Writes:   Sweetie has fast become a volunteer favorite. She’s amazing around other dogs (she lived with one who is in the kennel next to her, and to whom she offers up kisses they pass.) She is amazing around people (she lived with kids, ages 1 month to 4 years, and apparently allowed them to climb all over her.) She is house trained to perfection, knows her basic commands, and is so friendly we argue over who gets the treat of her lovely company on a walk (she’s a dream on a leash.)   This gorgeous girl is Sweetie. We rescued her from the NYC ACC literally moments before her time was up with her buddie Spike. She is a wonderul dog and is doing well in foster care. She is good with other dogs, kids and is house broken. It's time this sweet girl found a forever home with her buddy Spike!  At the time of adoption a donation of $250 (dogs over 6 months) and $350 (dogs 6 months and under) is requested before the animal is placed in a new home.     *IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ANIMAL, PLEASE SUBMIT  AN ADOPTION APPLICATION  AND ONCE APPROVED, SOMEONE FROM THIS ORGANIZATION WILL CONTACT YOU.

I Play Fetch!Bentley was born about August 7, 2013 and weighs about 15 lbs. He is cute as a button and needs a new home because a human baby came along and he didn't much care for the noisy little being and truly missed the human attention he had received in the past. He is fine with other dogs, large and small and doing pretty well on house training. These tiny dogs often struggle throughout their lifetimes with this issue and often benefit from having potty floor pads handy for those just in case moments. He is good on leash and is said to need a leash or fenced yard as he can have some wanderlust if left unattended outside. Bentley does love car rides and he will play fetch. He also will play tug, but that is not a good thing to teach a dog that is territorial as it puts the human equal to the dog. We are told that he did nip a visiting 5 year old child, so no kids. He adores his own humans and loves to warm laps. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $125.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

03/29/2016	Ellie (Black) - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). The absolute look of despair and anguish on this neglected puppies face just shattered out hearts. At just 3 months of age, Ellie has been neglected and mistrea ... ted enough for a life-time. When most pups are playing and being doted upon, she was merely thrown a leftover every once in a while. We immediately wanted to just hug her and tell her that everything will be ok. She is suffering from a preventable skin condition called mange. She will be transported to our vet partner first thing tomorrow morning for treatment. We hope that you will join us to give Ellie her second chance. Please consider donating for her vet care at www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/donate

03/29/2016	SPIKE - Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Southampton, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: Terrier / Mixed. Please note that we can not guarantee the age or breed of any animal. What we provide is our best estimates based on our experience and the information provided by the our medical partners.Approx. 5 year old Terrier Mix Male Foster Update:  Spike & Sweetie are a bonded pair who joined our ""pack"" 2 weeks ago. Spike is 5 years old and just a big love bug. He just wants to be wherever you are. Sweetie is 12 years old and her name says it all. Both really love being outside. Spike enjoys playing balls. They came from a home with children and get along well with other dogs. Spike gives Sweetie love and goes over to her and licks her....it's pretty great to watch. These 2 would make a great addition to any home!!!  A volunteer writes:  “Carpe Diem” is the powerful moto that feeds Spike’s spirit … Lay your eyes on him and he will be all yours…. Be ready for the ride… Spike is an energetic boy who sometimes gets some silly thoughts, some craves like pregnant ladies can have. A big one is Spike’s affinity for cones. His eyes almost come out of their sockets..He must have have them and “cherish” them… He was a big player in his former home, balls, empty plastic bottles got him all excited and i guess , he took that with him . He loves balls and will jump and run for hours catching one ball after the other, not guarding them even that i saw him storing three of them in his big mouth. Although thrilled by toys, Spike will sit and wait for them …He can indeed give paw, only the left for me… Spike is an almost middle aged gentleman, well built, healthy, well groomed and smartly dressed in acinnamon and vanilla coat that announces his tender side…Yep, he likes to be petted and even kissed after a good ball game. Spike does pull on the leash, seems very much house trained and is quite “proper” when he meets other dogs. He is cool in playgroups with his peers. Spike , adopted as a very young boy from the Manhattan Care Center came to us with 12 year old Stinkie, his beloved housemate as their owners lost their home. Like Sweetie, he has been beautifully cared for. He comes with excellent comments that nevertheless stress his strength. Spike is a big boy, quite enthusiastic , strong, playful and friendly. He performed quite well on his behavioral evaluation, lived with kids, another dog and could make quite a nice companion once he will be out of his tight space, cared for and loved. Older children would probably be best (if any) seen Spike is quite energetic.   This handsome boy is Spike. We rescued him from the NYC ACC literally moments before his time was up with his buddie Sweetie. He is a wonderul dog and is doing well in foster care. He is good with other dogs and is house broken. It's time this sweet boy found a forever home with hids buddy!  At the time of adoption a donation of $250 (dogs over 6 months) and $350 (dogs 6 months and under) is requested before the animal is placed in a new home.     *IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ANIMAL, PLEASE SUBMIT  AN ADOPTION APPLICATION  AND ONCE APPROVED, SOMEONE FROM THIS ORGANIZATION WILL CONTACT YOU.

My name is BELLA BLUE and I'm a GORGEOUS 5 yr F Blue Brindle Cane Corso. I'm 90 lbs of PURE BLUE BEAUTY. Due to no fault of my own and an unforseen circumstance, I am being rehomed. I am friendly, loving and have medium energy. I've been around other dogs but am selective and unless you are experienced in handling my breed, it's best that I am an ""ONLY DOG"" plus I like to have all the attention to myself. I'm used to having a large yard to roam in so I'd prefer a home in the country as opposed to a city apt. I've not been around young kids so it's best if I go to an ""Adult Only"" home or older kids ages 12 yrs +. I am a very athletic dog and would love to go on long walks and hikes. I am super loyal and will stick to you like glue.. all that I ask is that you give me the attention and leadership I need and I will be your BFF forever!

He clocked in at nearly 125 pounds when he came in in January and just didn't look like he was in good condition. We saw his sweet, smiling face and couldn't r esist. No dog deserves for things to end like this! As you can see from the photo on the right, Benny's grin only widened when we sprung him.

More importantly, he's got a wonderful temperament and so much to offer a Badass family. Note that he doesn't like the vet much, but he's otherwise a friend to everybody.

He has his AM, Potty breaks and Nighttime routines down pat! I put zero effort into training him. He actually thanks YOU with a big ole grin!!! He knows exactly when you need him to be calm and when you need him to be silly- trust me, he knows when you're having a rough day and he cheers you right up! Lol! He gets along great with everyone. He def would do best in an active household. We go on long walks, hikes or just play games with him because he gets anxious if too much time goes between activity in between. What I mean is, although every day would be ideal (I mean, that's every pup! Haha!) he can go a few days in between with regular activity. He's understanding like that. What a great reason to get out there and get moving if that's the kind of thing you NEED or WANT but might be having a hard time doing. If you're already active he can def keep up!!! We love him with all our hearts and are so lucky to have him while he waits for his forever family. He has made us better people in the time he's been here. Inside and out. ð  FOSTER UPDATE: I'm Harry's foster Mom! I can't tell you how amazing he is. Harry has this way about him that will just change your mood from bad to great as soon as you see his face.

The shelter is no place for a lady like Queenie. She is active and loves to run and play but a little play goes a long way for this girl. She''s looking for someone who wants to have some fun with her then cuddle up and relax together. After being here for 2 years the shelter environment has become stressful for this lady. People constantly walking by and staring at her makes her a little crazy so she gets to hang out in a quiet area out of sight. If you come to meet this Queen just ask the front desk and they will have her brought out for you to see. Queenie has made some doggy friends but she''s very stressed here and has become dog selective. Ask to talk to a trainer if you have other dogs so we can see if it will be a good fit. Queenie is one smart lady and has lots of training on her. She knows sit, down, stay, go to place, drop and more. She''s looking for someone who''s willing to continue working her mind. With all the treats her friends at the shelter give her she''s lost her figure so she''s also needing a family who will give her lots of exercise.

I am loving life with my foster dad, it feels so good to feel loved, not to mention sleeping in a nice warm house. I love to play, sometimes I am a litle rough but I am learning how to politely take toys from my foster dad's hands, I just get so excited when he says it's play time. I am doing GREAT with potty training, I walk well on a leash AND I sleep in my crate at night...So I am kind of like the triple threat. If you are looking for a happy guy, if you have a lot of love to give, and you'd like to play fetch with me, I am pretty sure I am your guy. I've never felt so much love than I have in the few short weeks that I have been with Sadie's. Max is neutered, microchipped and up to date on all vaccinations.   Apply today at www.sadiesrescue.org!                
03/29/2016	Iggy - Jack Russell Terrier / Italian Greyhound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Italian Greyhound-Jack Russell Terrier Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Baby	"Posted Breed: Jack Russell Terrier / Italian Greyhound / Mixed (short coat). I have Freedom!Iggy was born about January 20, 2010 and weighs about 22 lbs. She is an adorable little girl that came out of a puppy mill, but baby making days are over and she's looking forward to living a lush life with humans that shower her with love and kindness. Iggy is a little shy at first, but is warming up quickly leading us to believe that she, at one time, was someone's pet. All to often humans find supposed ""good homes"" for their pets and if the pets are not spayed or neutered they can easily end up in puppy mills to sit in a cage 24/7 and this tiny thing lived in a barn! Just imagine what goes through their minds as they sit there, and sit there, and sit there, wondering where the human is that loved them. She has been wonderful with all of us. We do feel she'd like to be the only pampered dog in the home. She will need some house training and may have been at one time. We will be working on this, but there will likely be work on your part with the new changes. She's a sweetie with a nice medium energy level and she has met children and was ok being around them, but not playful with them. She is mostly a quiet girl. We are truly, really, guessing at breed. She is good in the car and when first put on leash may go this way and that way, but then she settles and walks nicely. We are saddened of what became of her life, but we are happy that she ended up here so we can find you! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $250.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.    Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.   YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES    We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list.

This is the newest member of EAB...Meet Bosco! He's a 7 month old pit mix that we just had to get out of the shelter.

He's learning how to behave like a fine young gentleman, learning manners, how to walk nicely on leash, not to jump on people and take treats gently. He's crate trained and potty trained, although he is still a pup and being in a shelter environment - he still has an occasional accident (but we are working very hard and he's been doing so well) He's a bit exciteable and full of puppy antics.

03/29/2016	Anastasia Paladino - Terrier / Foxhound / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	English Foxhound-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Baby	"Posted Breed: Terrier / Foxhound / Mixed. The James Patrick ""Paladino"" Transport! Anastasia was born about January 9, 2016 and is the pup of our Grace. As for breed, Grace has very distinct, tiny, ears, so I'm going with a Fox Terrier mix with emphasis on mix! Grace weighs about 20 lbs. and is a little love! We have no clue who the father was so these pups may be smaller or larger than Grace. Please don't let this major cuteness judge your good common sense. If you are looking for something specific, including size, then these pups may not be for you. They are a surprise package! Anastasia is a snuggler and she ADORES water!  This transport is in honor and loving memory of our nephew, Patrick James Paladino, who passed away suddenly at the young age of 29. He was a devilish sort of boy, with a smile that would take your breath away and one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen. His sidekick and best friend, Duke, an American Staffordshire Bulldog, went everywhere with Patrick and the bond they shared was incredible. Duke now can be see everywhere with Patrick's father, Carl and is a permanent fixture on any of the couches in the Ellicott Square offices.  Many years ago a small, white dog ""supposedly"" followed Pat home from school. He begged his mother to let him keep him; she did. He named him Buttons and had him for years. This is one of my favorite stories about Pat, as I feel he rescued this dog long before Animal Rescues ever existed.  Joe and I chose rescue as our way to honor Patrick.  We can see him smiling as this wonderful rescue is about to take place in his name. We also felt we wanted to mention the three humans whose lives were also saved due to his parents selfless act of choosing organ donation.   Patrick, your nieces and nephews are very excited about this and have already picked out names. So let this journey begin and load up this truck, with your spirit protecting and guiding our precious transporters to where the once abandoned and abused will be rescued and cared for, until that special soul comes along that will give them their second chance at life, their forever home and most of all, love, just like you did that day you rescued Buttons so many years ago.

Mabel was found on the side of a road in SC and taken to a high kill shelter where she narrowly escaped death...Miss Mabel is a 7-9yo 30 lb female boxer mix, and one of the sweetest dogs you will ever meet. She is recovering from vestibular problems, which affects her balance, and a broken pelvis, but she is determined to walk where she wants to go, and not be carried! She is hesitant of stairs, and this is good right now, as she is still recovering. She would fit in well with any family, as she does well with other dogs, cats and children. Her foster says that Mabel is a tolerant & gentle soul, who expects nothing from humans, and appreciates every bit of attention she receives. To show her appreciation, she will give you a soft kiss, or rest her head in your lap. She also says that Mabel is extremely gentle with her 2.5 and 4.5 yr old children. Mabel is crate trained, house broken, and goes to the bathroom quickly when taken outside.                
03/29/2016	BANDIT - Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Southampton, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: Terrier / Mixed. Please note that we can not guarantee the age or breed of any animal. What we provide is our best estimates based on our experience and the information provided by the our medical partners.Approx. 3 year old Terrier Mix MaleA volunteer writes: Say hello to 114 pounds of pure LOVE! A big ol’ meatball with the softest nature and a million dollar smile, Bandit is out to steal ALL the hearts. He’s wonderfully friendly with people but if you really want to see his social prowess in action, playgroup is the place to be. Marvel at his gentle patience and low-key energy levels, laugh at his goofy trotting after the ladies and wonder just how anyone could let such a sweetheart go. Despite his hefty size and elbow callouses Bandit is actually only three years old, and like any youngster he loves to get out and explore; trotting happily down the street and taking care of all his business promptly, saluting passing dogs with a wagging tail and just luxuriating in the pleasure of a sunny day in the park. He’s a pretty good listener and will come and sit on command, but my treat rewards hold no interest (not even hot dog!) and I suspect Bandit has been on a diet of ‘people food’ for quite some time. Just imagine what an active lifestyle and TLC will do for this already gorgeous guy, he’s going to be a head-turner for sure. Of all the wonderful reasons to love Bandit, cuddle time is definitely in my top three. He adores being the center of attention and nothing beats seeing the look of absolute bliss on his face as he enjoys a good full-body rubdown–when Bandit smiles, the whole world smiles with him! Already neutered and ready to leave today, Bandit would make a wonderful pet for almost any family, and he so deserves the chance to live a long, healthy and snuggle-filled life. This handsome boy is Bandit. We rescued him from the NYC ACC literally moments before his time was up. He is a wonderul dog and is doing well in foster care. He is good with other dogs and kids and is ""full of lots of love."" It's time this sweet boy found a forever home!

Ascot suffered from a broken left leg that needed immediate medical attention After we rescued him we had him transported to our vet partner for an extensive medical work up.. X-rays were completed and Ascot was examined by our Board Certified Surgeon and it was determined Ascots break was old and nothing much could be done at this point Ascot uses the left leg maybe 20% of the time for stability so we are grateful the leg did not need amputation. Now that Ascots medical condition has been determined he's looking for a foster or adopter as he's ready to leave our vet partner. Ascot is sweet and has the typical rottie personality so a savvy rottie person would be best.

Hello all, my name is Dixie, my foster mom calls me a typical Southern Belle! I was surrendered to ACDRA by a back yard breeder, my main job was to just have puppies. Ugh, that is no life for a Southern lady! Foster mom has been taking care of me and teaching me that there is more to life than just being stuck in backyard.  I am a good girl who loves to go for walks, runs, hikes, but I am also good with a good snuggle on the couch. I walk well on leash, foster mom says I pull a little but hey, I like to get in all the good sniffs I can! I am also crate and house trained! See I am a spectacular student!  In my foster home I live with dogs and cats but I would prefer to be the only love of your life. Ya see, I like other dogs and all, but sometimes I like to herd them and I am learning that not all dogs like that. Again, being a true Southern Princess I like all the attention to myself!  I love all people but I can be a little shy at first when I meet them. It takes me a little bit of time to warm up, but once I know you, I will love you forever! I would be prefer to not go home with small kids, all those fast movements and loud noises make me really nervous. If you are looking for a sweet Southern Belle with a big cattle dog personality, then look no further you found me! If you have any questions or would like to set up a time to meet me please contact my assistant/foster mom, her information is below!

Approx. 1 year old Pit Bull Terrier Mix Female  This pretty girl is Rose. We rescued her from the NYC ACC literally moments before her time was up. A volunteer writes: Would a rose by any other name be as sweet? You betcha! Miss Rose is anxious in her kennel, thrilled to be out for a walk to make new friends. She’s understandably anxious as she had been with her family since she was 10 days old, and now she’s not.This is a whole new scary world that she’s left to conquer on her own.They tell us she’s energetic, lived with a young child and played gently with her. And how’s this for a fun fact: she likes to dance on her hind legs when she hears Salsa or Merengue music.How cute is that?! Rose hasn’t had a lot of experience outside of her immediate family, although she’s been beautifully taken care of.Her coat is shiny, her weight ample, and she’s friendly but anxious. I’m happy to count Rose among my new friends, and do note the need for some training. She likes to jump on new people, and her former family tells us that when she’s with people she knows she will bark at new people. Rose needs to learn that the world is populated with friendly people, that she can meet new people appropriately and the world is there for her to feel safe.It will take a patient person with the skills to teach Rose how to be the best she can be.It's time this sweet girl found a forever home!

03/29/2016	Dance - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Garden City, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat). UPDATE: Since her original description was written, Dance has been progressing by leaps and bounds! She will now take toys and collect them in a pile, even being brave enough to sneak over by her foster mom to grab one for her stash! She is also taking tasty treats from people's hands now! She is very playful with the other dogs in her foster home, eagerly engaging them in games of chase and wrestle.  She is very smart, and quickly learns routines. She very much enjoys going for walks, and walks very nicely on a harness and leash. Although not yet brave enough to approach her foster mom for pets on her own, she will now lie down and accept petting and attention when it is given. She really seems to like it, but she still is nervous about the situation. Dance is never aggressive in any way, rather she will run away and/or hide when she gets overwhelmed. However, this is happening less and less, as she learns what it's like to live in a home full of love. Dance spent a week with another volunteer as an &quot;only dog&quot; while her foster mom was out of town. Although she did well enough, it was clear that she would do best in a home with other dogs. She truly lets go of her tension and anxiety when she is able to interact and play with her own kind. That said, when she came back to her foster home from her mini vacation, she greeted her foster mom with a wagging tail! This is a girl who truly wants connection and a loving and patient forever family.   Dance is a young adult (~2 years old) cattle dog who came into a shelter in Kentucky with her litter of seven tiny puppies! She was an amazing mom, and her lovely puppies have all been adopted. Now, it's Dance's turn to find a loving forever family! When she arrived in foster care, she was pretty worried after all the changes in her life. As she is settling into her foster home, she is slowly blossoming. Dance has a beautiful spirit. She really wants to bond and trust people, but right now, she is still learning to be brave. When she gets nervous, she will often hide from people or dart frantically around looking for escape if she feels trapped. The good news is, she is gaining courage daily! She has begun to allow her foster mom reach out to her and pet her under her chin! So far, Dance is not interested in playing with toys, but she does *love* to play with her foster siblings. When foster mom is peeking out the sliding glass door to the yard, she can see a very happy Dance, cavorting around with the other pups, enticing them to play with her!  Dance’s story is just beginning – will you help her write the rest of her chapters? She is looking for an adoptive home with people who are patient and loving and who willing to help her to blossom. She needs confident and calm adopters who will allow her to progress at her own pace. She requests that her adoptive family have a confident and playful dog in the home to help her progress, and who can be a playmate and role model for her! She absolutely must have a securely fenced yard (no invisible fences, please) to keep her safe – fearful dogs can panic and bolt – running blindly and quickly becoming lost, or worse. Dance gets a little too excited about cats so would do best in a cat free home.  Dance is up to date on vaccines, spayed, and negative for heartworm and tick borne diseases. She is current on her preventatives and is currently eating a diet grain free kibble. Interested adopters must be willing to travel to meet Dance at her foster home, about 30 minutes south of Albany, NY.

Thank You Rochester Team! Every Saturday, whether rain, sleet, snow or sunshine, Joyful Rescues' dynamic team of volunteers on our Rochester team show up at Webster PetSmart doing everything they can to help homeless dogs and cats find a ""forever home"" and get a second chance for a life full of love and happiness. Their dedication and commitment to animal rescue doesn't end with giving their time....something most of us feel we never have enough of. They also coordinate many fundraisers, special adoption showings, present educational programs, foster dogs in their homes, lobby in Albany against puppy mills, gather donations from the community to meet our needs, distribute donation jars to businesses in their area and collect the money from them monthly, make beautiful handmade merchandise for pets and pet lovers to sell at craft events, turn in bottles and cans and send the refunded deposits to Joyful Rescues, and the list goes on. Yet they always look for ways to do MORE! Well, they've just done MORE! They decided to pitch in whatever they could until they came up with enough money to sponsor their own life saving transport...$500.00... and they did it! Thank you to our amazing Rochester volunteer team! You've all found yet another way to make a world of difference for the homeless pets in need. Aryanna was born about Decembdr 12, 2014 and weighs about 12 lbs. She is a really cute that came to us with a terrible respiratory and eye infection which resulted in a small apot of vision loss in one eye due to scarring, but she can see just fine. She is ultimately sweet and highly devoted to the humans that she loves!  Along with this devotion comes a bit of protection of her human with another dog if she is in your lap which is her favorite place to be. She is not noisy which I love. Aryanna did well during our cat test, but we've found that she'd rather not live with small children. We are still learning about Aryanna, but what we have learned we love.

One of our volunteers friends goes to college in Florida and decided to rescue a dog from craigslist with her roomate. They named her Rosie and Rosie was being given away for free. If they didn't get her, who knows what could've happened to her. Well it turns out that they weren't allowed to house Rosie and she had to find other living arrangements. Between the rescuers friend taking her in and letting her live in their appartment to moving to a local foster home of a fellow animal lover, Rosie only had a stable spot in NY, back with the rescuers family. Rosie flew to NY and is now in foster care on Long Island. She is great with dogs of all sizes but is too interested in cats. She likes to chase them and get in their face. Not sure if she'd be best in a home with a feline friend, but would love a doggie friend who she could run around with to get her puppy energy out! She loves to cuddle, run, play, and give kisses! She definitely needs a place where she can get her energy out, but also a place with someone to snuggle with at the end of the day. Rosie is housebroken and crate trained and ready to find her forever home!

Cappy is 6 months old and approximately 25 pounds. He is an absolute love bug. So happy to meet new people and he loves everyone. Kids that are dog savvy are his favorite. Cappy lives on a working horse farm with cats, free range chickens, puppies and lots of older dogs. He respects the horses and ignores the chickens and cats. He has some spacial awareness issues with the other dogs and tends to bounce off of them, stand on them challenge them for their bones and flat out can be a brat. The older dogs here will put him in his place and the younger dogs tolerate his shenanigans to a point. That being said he needs some work in the manners department.  Cappy loves to play ball and returns it to you almost always. We go for walks off leash daily and he loves to explore, never too far away and he always comes when he is called. Excellent recall. Cappy loves to snuggle and he sleeps in his crate or in bed usually all night. Sometimes needing a potty break in the middle of the night. A strict feeding schedule should take care of that.   We were told Cappy was house trained and would ring a bell on the door to go out. We have not tested that theory and Cappy has peed in the house twice. Maybe we should hang a bell. That being said I wont say he is house broke but he is very good about going outside to go potty. Cappy is a normal want to be at your side and do everything you are doing kind of dog. However car rides make him sick. VERY sick. We do take him on small 10-20 minute runs trying to help with this. He has made it this far without throwing up but it tends to take his appetite away. He is a skinny mini so we prefer him to eat. That being said if your looking for a truck dog you will have your work cut out for you. Cappy still does puppy things such as play rough, play bite and jump when greeting new people. Consistency in training will help with all of this. We find that Cappy is an absolute doll. He is fun and so happy. Easy to train and just a pleasure to foster. Super personality. It is hard to get photos of him as he is never still unless he is sleeping.  Cappy is being fostered in Littlestown, PA. If interested, please contact kimberlykanely@gmail.com. COMPLETE AN APPLICATION http://www.acdra.org/#!adoption-application-/c21x6                
03/29/2016	Farley - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	New York, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Farley is a year and half of age, weighing approximately 45-50 pounds. He was underweight when he came into rescue and has been slowly putting weight back on. Farley is a really sweet boy and gets along great with other submissive dogs! He doesnt really understand the social signals and he loves to play, so submissive types are best if other dogs are in the home. He tested well with cats, and does great with kids and adults. Farley is housetrained, but needs work on leash and with basic commands. He loves attention and likes to lay across laps like a cat! He loves to eat, and because of his past we guess he may have had to jostle for food therefore is best to feed separately from others in the home. Everyone who meets him is in love with him as he is a total sweetheart!  Farley would love a place to call home!

Thank You Rochester Team! Every Saturday, whether rain, sleet, snow or sunshine, Joyful Rescues' dynamic team of volunteers on our Rochester team show up at Webster PetSmart doing everything they can to help homeless dogs and cats find a ""forever home"" and get a second chance for a life full of love and happiness. Their dedication and commitment to animal rescue doesn't end with giving their time....something most of us feel we never have enough of. They also coordinate many fundraisers, special adoption showings, present educational programs, foster dogs in their homes, lobby in Albany against puppy mills, gather donations from the community to meet our needs, distribute donation jars to businesses in their area and collect the money from them monthly, make beautiful handmade merchandise for pets and pet lovers to sell at craft events, turn in bottles and cans and send the refunded deposits to Joyful Rescues, and the list goes on. Yet they always look for ways to do MORE! Well, they've just done MORE! They decided to pitch in whatever they could until they came up with enough money to sponsor their own life saving transport...$500.00... and they did it! Thank you to our amazing Rochester volunteer team! You've all found yet another way to make a world of difference for the homeless pets in need. Aryanna was born about Decembdr 12, 2014 and weighs about 12 lbs. She is a really cute that came to us with a terrible respiratory and eye infection which resulted in a small apot of vision loss in one eye due to scarring, but she can see just fine. She is ultimately sweet and highly devoted to the humans that she loves!  Along with this devotion comes a bit of protection of her human with another dog if she is in your lap which is her favorite place to be. She is not noisy which I love. Aryanna did well during our cat test, but we've found that she'd rather not live with small children. We are still learning about Aryanna, but what we have learned we love.

This is Sammy, He is really a great dog. I know because I go see him at boarding I am a volunteer with SCR. Sammy stayed at my house so he wouldn't be alone the past two nights. He gets scared with the barking at boarding. He goes in a corner and shakes at times. Everyone at boarding does what they can to make him feel safe and loved, But at the end of the day he sleeps all by himself. He is very friendly, did really well with my dogs ... . He gets very attached to you. Doesn't like being in a crate and has some separation anxiety. Can you blame him though? Every time he thinks he has a family someone leaves him. He loves the yard. He sleeps through the night on a doggie bed. He does jump over gates in my house but its not to wonder off and make trouble. He just wants to be where you are. He takes treats very gently and will sit for you even before you reward him. He was a little shy when he met my husband but within seconds he was wagging his tail and was acting like he lived in our home his entire life. He walks great on a leash. NO pulling at all. Sammy's visit was over this morning and he went back to boarding today cry emoticon He needs a foster family or better yet a forever home. I am at my legal limit with pets so Sammy can't live with me. BUT he can live with a loving family who is willing to give him a home. He needs the offers. Please consider this very very sweet boy. He doesn't deserve this. Sammy is a beagle/mix 3.5 years old. Neutered and up to date on his vetting. Good with DOGS will do well with CATS and CHILDREN. http://www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/app-form/

They also coordinate many fundraisers, special adoption showings, present educational programs, foster dogs in their homes, lobby in Albany against puppy mills, gather donations from the community to meet our needs, distribute donation jars to businesses in their area and collect the money from them monthly, make beautiful handmade merchandise for pets and pet lovers to sell at craft events, turn in bottles and cans and send the refunded deposits to Joyful Rescues, and the list goes on. Yet they always look for ways to do MORE! Well, they've just done MORE! They decided to pitch in whatever they could until they came up with enough money to sponsor their own life saving transport...$500.00... and they did it! Thank you to our amazing Rochester volunteer team! You've all found yet another way to make a world of difference for the homeless pets in need. Lacy was born about December 11, 2007 and weighs about 35 lbs. She is an adorable, rather, fluffy girl that is wonderful with all of us humans but we feel she would rather be the only dog in the home. She is nicely house trained and crate trained and is not a noisy girl which we love here. She is going to be a devoted companion for someone looking for love! Lacy did well during our cat test and she's been excellent with children as young as two. She is fine on leash, but hesitant about new situations. Lacy is fine in the car.

He was surrendered by his owner because they could no longer afford to care for him. Simba is a very sweet boy who currently is fairly timid and scared. Once he's had time to acclimate to his surroundings, he blossoms into a quite loving/affectionate boy who wants nothing more than to please.

03/29/2016	Lilly Paladino - Collie / Feist / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Collie-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Collie / Feist / Mixed (medium coat). The James Patrick ""Paladino"" Transport! Lilly was born about February 22, 2015 and weighs about 30 lbs. She is a pretty little girl that was an excellent passenger on the way up. So far she is simply a all-around, nice, mixed breed pooch that is looking for a new home. The shelter kills so fast that they don't bother to gather much information about the dogs so we will be learning as we go. She has been wonderful with all of us and the other dogs.  This transport is in honor and loving memory of our nephew, Patrick James Paladino, who passed away suddenly at the young age of 29. He was a devilish sort of boy, with a smile that would take your breath away and one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen. His sidekick and best friend, Duke, an American Staffordshire Bulldog, went everywhere with Patrick and the bond they shared was incredible. Duke now can be see everywhere with Patrick's father, Carl and is a permanent fixture on any of the couches in the Ellicott Square offices.  Many years ago a small, white dog ""supposedly"" followed Pat home from school. He begged his mother to let him keep him; she did. He named him Buttons and had him for years. This is one of my favorite stories about Pat, as I feel he rescued this dog long before Animal Rescues ever existed.  Joe and I chose rescue as our way to honor Patrick.  We can see him smiling as this wonderful rescue is about to take place in his name. We also felt we wanted to mention the three humans whose lives were also saved due to his parents selfless act of choosing organ donation.   Patrick, your nieces and nephews are very excited about this and have already picked out names. So let this journey begin and load up this truck, with your spirit protecting and guiding our precious transporters to where the once abandoned and abused will be rescued and cared for, until that special soul comes along that will give them their second chance at life, their forever home and most of all, love, just like you did that day you rescued Buttons so many years ago. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $325.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Just Released From a Puppy Mill!Beans was born about March 20, 2009 and weighs about 11 lbs. She is just adorable and was wonderful while we were handling her for vaccines and photos. Although this girl has lived her life in a cage birthing puppies for pet store shelves she is quite social and we feel she should turn around nicely and begin acting more like a normal dog, who had a normal life, in the near future. She will need house training as she has been in a cage 24/7 eating,sleeping, and going potty with the bottom of the cage being wire so the waste falls through to a tray. We have a lot of good information on our main website to help you with turning around a mill dog. Please do a little reading before applying for this cutie as she will be a project for awhile and your response to her behavior is key in the speed at which she recovers from her past. She is wonderful with other dogs and most mill dogs do better with another normal dog in the house showing them the ropes! A mill dog can be a bit of work, but the moment that you see the look of love in their eyes it is the most rewarding feeling in the world!!!!  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $375.00.

03/29/2016	KAHLUA - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Hampton Bays, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat). Khalua was recently rescued from Puerto Rico during a rescue mission. After settling in at the Southampton Animal Shelter and getting checkups from the medical and training staff, she is ready to be adopted! The Southampton Animal Shelter''s Outreach Program teamed up with Animal Lighthouse Rescue. This was our second rescue mission to Puerto Rico to SAVE THE SATOS.Puerto Rico is known for its blue skies, palm trees and beautiful beaches, but there is something terrible going on in Puerto Rico. The island has turned into a horrible overpopulation nightmare of backyard breeding, puppy stores, mix breed discrimination, abandoned pets, neglect, mistreatment and abuse. The overpopulation of strays is due to the failure to spay and neuter. There are an estimated 300,000 dogs roaming the streets and dying on the roads and beaches daily.                
03/29/2016	Precious - Shih Tzu / Mixed (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Shih Tzu-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Senior	"Posted Breed: Shih Tzu / Mixed (long coat). Looking for a Bright Future!Precious was born about March 5, 2008 and weighs about 15 lbs. She could stand to drop a few and that should happen easily once she understands how to play and what zoomies are! She was recently released from a life of pumping out puppies for pet store shelves spending her entire life in a small cage, with a wire bottom, in a puppy mill!!!! She is looking forward to a bright future in a real home with a real family to love her. She is wonderful with other dogs and another ""normal"" dog would be to her benefit to show her what life is all about. Precious so wants to be loved and give love but she doesn't know how yet. Her tail wags non-stop but when you reach to pet her, off she goes. Patience will need to be had with Precious to show her that humans can be kind. She is not potty trained and this is done no different than you would a puppy, we recommend using a crate and have many tips on www.joyfulrescues.org about working with mill dogs. She has no idea how to walk on leash yet and truly would benefit from having a safely fenced yard. Just imagine what it is like for this girl to feel snow and grass on her tiny, little, pads. She is starting to get the hang of nylabones and you may catch her looking at you with one sticking out of her mouth like a cigar. She didn't know what to do with it, but knew she liked it! She needs time, patience and kindness and we do suggest using floor potty pads for mill dogs as they learn to ""hold it"" and often these small dogs benefit from floor pads throughout life since their bladders are just smaller in proportion than larger dogs. She is a happy dog, just needs to learn how to be a dog and not a money making machine. Update: Sadly, this little girl has some odd hair loss and so we ran blood work and Dr. Hite at Camp Road Animal Hospital is doing some research on a possible endocrine problem. Is she available for adoption? Well, yes, to someone willing to care for her with this condition. We will update when we know more. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $75.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.    Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.

He has stayed in the house with no incidents when I wasn't home for 6 hours.  Mugsy is fine with my dogs. He likes to play and run in the yard. He is almost 2 years old. He is sweet and loving with people. He is just a doll who has waited too long for his Forever Home!!  Mugsy is neutered and up to date on shots.

My name is Esperanza, and I''m a five-year-old Labrador mix. I''m a sweet girl, very pretty (if I do say so myself), but a little shy. I was born in Puerto Rico, where my life was hard on the street and then a shelter.

I'm Cute & Funny!Ruger was born about August 25, 2015 and will top out about 10 lbs. He is as cute as any little pup can be and has gorgeous coloring. He is fun and funny as typical of his breeds. We are not sure if his mama was bred accidentally or on purpose, but he was sold and then the person brought him back to the breeder because she could not care for him. He is good with other dogs and cats alike. If there are kids they should be a bit older and respectful as when he is frightened, cornered, etc., he can be Chihuahua kind of nippy. Ruger is good on leash and in the car. The breeder who had him a bit before he came here said he was somewhat house trained so you'll probably have some work there. Also, we want to warn you that so many of these tiny dogs benefit from having potty floor pads handy throughout their lives.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $325.00.

03/29/2016	Andrew - Hound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Whitestone, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed (short coat). UPDATE ANDREW... For those of you who may not know Andrew's story he was co-housed with Astrid, and another dog in a shelter. Astrid sadly passed away from a blood clot in her lungs, the damage from her injuries where just to much for our sweet girl. Andrew also sustained very bad injuries from this fight. As mentioned in an earlier post, we do not know what caused this horrific fight. Being co-housed, feeling lost, confused, so much to consider. Shelters are a horrible place ...  to be. They are scary, and the high stress level is very bad for these poor dogs. Andrew is now healing and getting better each day and is looking for a Foster or better yet an Adopter. Andrew is adored and was known as a staff favorite at the shelter. Andrew tested very well with other dogs. He is a sweet boy. He presently is being treated for an Upper Respiratory Infection and is expected to make a full recovery. He is a happy boy who has so much love in his heart. What he needs is a family who wants to love him and give him a great home. Andrew is 3 years old and a perfect size at 44 pounds. We would love to tell Andrew he will have a home to go to after he gets medical clearance to make his way on transport.

Ralphie is a friendly,sweet lab mix pup who is around 7 months old, 35 pounds. He is a gentle sweetheart who is great with kids (we suggest 10 and up due to his vision issue and he is a puppy, so he is still a bit of a jumper), he's great with dogs and even cats....he is a love! Ralphie is mostly blind, the vet says he may see shadows, but he still bumps into things and startles easily. He is working on his housetraining, will sit on command sometimes, and is crate trained. He will need a home with another calm dog to keep him company, and  would do best in a home where he won't be left alone for long stretches of time . Ralphie is still a puppy, and as with all puppies an adopter will have to be willing to work with him on his housebreaking, leash skills and training that all puppies need to help them grow into a well rounded adult dog. He is a lovable puppy who will be a great new addition for a lucky family.

A volunteer writes: Choco is already a big boy at eight months of age…His square face topped by butterfly ears, his big puzzled and naive eyes….He is plain adorable…Choco is no pound puppy, though..He is a strong babe who pulls on the leash and engages in rambunctious and mouthy play with other dogs in playgroups. He likes to jump high and he is known to chew on household items when his family is away…The very reason his owners relinquished him to the care center. Choco comes otherwise with excellent recommendations. He lived and played gently with the children of the house and is said to be very playful and affectionate…Choco’s little boy face got me.. Really cute.. He comes when called, sits very nicely on command, does his business without marking and puts his head right in my lap for petting…Choco is a high energy puppy, very enthusiastic who needs basic training in puppy savvy hands and he will be an awesome adult, in looks and character. He has goodness in him, a great core..He just needs the polish…Let’s not waste his life because he only needs basic training…Choco is just eight month old and has a long life in front to of him but only if you give him a chance, the chance to be his new master and teacher.

Please note that we can not guarantee the age or breed of any animal. What we provide is our best estimates based on our experience and the information provided by the our medical partners.Approx. 2 year old Lab Mix FemaleHi, my name is Emmie! I'm a 50lb, 2 yr old lab mix from South Carolina. I used to live in a home but my family brought me to a loud, scary shelter and never came back for me. I was terrified and would sit in the back of my kennel and hide. Last Chance Animal Rescue saved me and brought me to NY, thank goodness! Emmie is completely housebroken, she sleeps in the crate and also stays there when we are not home. She loves walks and to play with squeaky toys, she never rips them (she actually cuddles with them when she's done playing).  Since coming to my foster home I have learned so many tricks! I know sit, paw, stay (sort of), lay down, and come. I love snuggling with my foster mom and dad and playing with my new toys. I'm a little clumsy, so I may accidentally knock over small children. However, this is something that can be rectified with training.    I'm not too trusting of other dogs, but with extra time and patience I learn that not all dogs are bad. I've gotten to know my foster brother, a pug, and we're good pals now. I try to play with my cat foster brother, but he hisses and swats at me, so I run away scared.  I've been in NY for a while now and I don't understand why no one wants to take me home. I love people and I'm always super sweet to everyone I meet. Won't you please be my forever home? Please share this post and help us find this beautiful girl her forever home, where she will surely spoil her new family with love and affection!  At the time of adoption a donation of $250 (dogs over 6 months) and $350 (dogs 6 months and under) is requested before the animal is placed in a new home.           *IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ANIMAL, PLEASE SUBMIT  AN ADOPTION APPLICATION  AND ONCE APPROVED, SOMEONE FROM THIS ORGANIZATION WILL CONTACT YOU.

03/29/2016	Lunes - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Garden City, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed (short coat). Meet Lunes!  Lunes is a striking, white ACD-mix with red highlights. She is approximately one year old and weighs 36 lbs., and has a tall thin frame. She is a very happy, high-energy, social dog.  Lunes walks well on leash if wearing a harness. She is completely crate and housetrained in her foster home. Still being in that puppy phase, she jumps up when excited. We are working on teaching her that this is not acceptable and proper greetings with people. She loves to either cuddle on the couch or rest at your feet. She has no resource guarding issues and takes turns when treats are handed out. Lunes likes to take her time when eating her meals, so we feed her in her crate or away from our four dogs. She absolutely loves her crate and can be found in there just hanging out with the door open. At night she sleeps on our living room couch or bedroom floor. Her crate is her sanctuary.  Lunes is a very social girl who loves playing with other dogs that are of a similar nature to herself. When meeting dogs that are of a stronger personality or more dominant than herself, she will be hesitant, so proper introductions during this formative time is very important to continue to build her confident personality. Lunes is frightened by cats so a home without cats is preferred.  Due to Lunes exuberance a household with older children is recommended. Also, it would be ideal if potential adopters could meet Lunes and make sure she will be a good fit.  Lunes needs a family that is active and will continue to provide the physical and mental stimulation needed to make her a happy and adjusted member in her new family. She would thrive in a home as the only dog and loves one-on-one engagement and daily opportunity to run full out in a large area. She does fetch but needs work on the ""leave"" command.  Lunes is up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed, and on flea and tick preventative.   Lunes is being fostered in Wilmington, DE.   Questions? Please contact Lunes' foster home at: ohdgarden@comcast.net.   COMPLETE AN APPLICATION http://www.acdra.org/#!adoption-application-/c21x6                "

Princessa was recently rescued from Puerto Rico during a rescue mission. After settling in at the Southampton Animal Shelter and getting checkups from the medical and training staff, she is ready to be adopted! The Southampton Animal Shelter''s Outreach Program teamed up with Animal Lighthouse Rescue. This was our second rescue mission to Puerto Rico to SAVE THE SATOS.Puerto Rico is known for its blue skies, palm trees and beautiful beaches, but there is something terrible going on in Puerto Rico. The island has turned into a horrible overpopulation nightmare of backyard breeding, puppy stores, mix breed discrimination, abandoned pets, neglect, mistreatment and abuse. The overpopulation of strays is due to the failure to spay and neuter. There are an estimated 300,000 dogs roaming the streets and dying on the roads and beaches daily.                
03/29/2016	OLI - Bullmastiff / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Bullmastiff-Unknown Mix	Hampton Bays, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Bullmastiff / Mixed (medium coat). Oli is a happy boy who doesnt know hes as big as he is. When Oli snuggles, he snuggles with his whole heart and whole body. He may even try to sit on you, just so he can be closer to you. When you pet Oli or just say his name, he goes into wiggle mode. His front end is wiggling one way, and his back end wiggles the other way. He is just a rolly-polly lovebug.Oli was found running around Bridgehampton on Butter Lane. He had on a leash and a collar. We tried to find his owner, but no one came forward. He may have been a Bridgehampton resident or someone could have dumped him there. It broke our hearts when no one came to claim him.

The communication was rough going, but our plea on Joyful's Facebook page found an interpreter to make the phone call and arrange for the pick up of Baby so she could come stay with us until you found her!  Thank you to all our FB fans for always coming through! This good girl is healing, perhaps, inside and out, and is waiting for you love. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $250.00.

03/29/2016	Dot - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Binghamton, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Dot is feeling better these days since her original ordeal which brought her to us. She had an emergency scare requiring surgery and it has been a struggle to get her regulated with her insulin since she came to us so ill. Now, Dot is enjoying her days and getting used to a regular routine at her CT foster home.  Dot will need a special home that is willing to give her insulin injections twice daily on a very regular schedule. These injections are easy to give as the insulin just needs to go under the skin and she has a lot of extra skin! She is also very good when she is getting her shots. She will need to stay on special food for the rest of her life as well. It’s called Glycobalance from Royal Canin and she eats 5 cups and one can of wet food every day. Finally, because her diabetes was so out of control, Dot developed cataracts and glaucoma in her eyes. Unfortunately this is irreversible, her eyesight is deteriorating and she will eventually be blind. Dot is now able to run and play and enjoys the company of other dogs after a slow and careful integration. We believe she should go to a house with no cats, and because she will be blind, only older children who will know to give her fair warning when they approach.  All of this sounds like a lot, but if you are the special home that can take on these responsibilities, Dot is soooo worth it and will reward you by demanding belly rubs and slurping on your face 24/7!

On top of that, they're doing an amazing job of finding them homes once we get them up here! What we do takes teamwork, and huge thanks to our Orchard Park volunteers for being part of our team!    Loren was born about November 17, 2015 and may top out in the 75'ish lb. range, but truly understand that we are just guessing. He is on the timid side and we might wonder if he was leftover in a litter that someone was trying to sell and they tired of having him, and his brother, still hanging around (and we are guessing outside) and dumped them at the high kill shelter. We SURE are glad we were there and scooped them up and brought them north. They are showing, absolutely, no aggression and they are warming up to us. Once in a normal environment with loving, patient, humans their personalities will blossom!  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $425.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

I Play Fetch!Bentley was born about August 7, 2013 and weighs about 15 lbs. He is cute as a button and needs a new home because a human baby came along and he didn't much care for the noisy little being and truly missed the human attention he had received in the past. He is fine with other dogs, large and small and doing pretty well on house training. These tiny dogs often struggle throughout their lifetimes with this issue and often benefit from having potty floor pads handy for those just in case moments. He is good on leash and is said to need a leash or fenced yard as he can have some wanderlust if left unattended outside. Bentley does love car rides and he will play fetch. He also will play tug, but that is not a good thing to teach a dog that is territorial as it puts the human equal to the dog. We are told that he did nip a visiting 5 year old child, so no kids. He adores his own humans and loves to warm laps. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $125.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Badass Benny Hill is on his way from Texas this weekend after narrowly escaping the shelter! 10 to 12 years old, Benny got surrendered to an overcrowded shelter because they were moving. He clocked in at nearly 125 pounds when he came in in January and just didn't look like he was in good condition. We saw his sweet, smiling face and couldn't r esist. No dog deserves for things to end like this! As you can see from the photo on the right, Benny's grin only widened when we sprung him. Benny's a bit creaky with arthritis as you'd expect, but he's improving with anti-inflammatories and taking off some of those extra pounds. More importantly, he's got a wonderful temperament and so much to offer a Badass family. Note that he doesn't like the vet much, but he's otherwise a friend to everybody. Benny's good with other dogs and people of all ages. He's housebroken, cratetrained, and just want someone Badass to share his golden years with. Benny is neutered, UTD on vaccinations, and microchipped. To foster or adopt, please visit our website at www.badassbk.com for an application.

Just Released From a Puppy Mill!Nina was born about March 22, 2007 and weighs about 10 lbs. She is just adorable and was wonderful while we were handling her for vaccines and photos. Although this girl has lived her life in a cage birthing puppies for pet store shelves she is quite social and we feel she should turn around nicely and begin acting more like a normal dog, who had a normal life, in the near future. She will need house training as she has been in a cage 24/7 eating,sleeping, and going potty with the bottom of the cage being wire so the waste falls through to a tray. We have a lot of good information on our main website to help you with turning around a mill dog. Please do a little reading before applying for this cutie as she will be a project for awhile and your response to her behavior is key in the speed at which she recovers from her past. She is wonderful with other dogs and most mill dogs do better with another normal dog in the house showing them the ropes! A mill dog can be a bit of work, but the moment that you see the look of love in their eyes it is the most rewarding feeling in the world!!!!  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $375.00.

Thank you Goodman Family! Joyful Rescues "" Goodman Transport"" has saved 16 lives! That number will soon grow as two of the dogs came in VERY pregnant. From the Goodman family - In these past two years my family has adopted two very sweet and spunky pups from Joyful Rescues. Radicchio (now Maddie) and Stormy (now Micayla) both have brought so much joy to our family. It was Maddie who came to us scared and shy, she was just hours away from being euthanized. It took her a couple months to forget about her past in Kentucky, however she is now a completely different dog.Upon realizing how happy the dogs have made our lives, we decided that we needed to find a way to give back! Our family came up with the idea to put together a bottle/can and pet supplies drive. We had delivered over 1,500 flyers around our community, and drive around once a month to pick up donations. We would like to thank everybody that has contributed to our efforts. After seven months we had saved up enough to sponsor a rescue. Over the summer we made the decision to continue the drive and created a phase II to help save even more dogs. It is really important to us that we give other dogs a second chance at life, just as Maddie and Micayla had received. ~ The Goodman Family Leigh Ann Goodman is the Mom to Beaut. Beaut was born October 23, 2015 and we feel they will be as big or bigger than Leigh Ann who weighs about 55 lbs. So, please plan on a pup weighting in the 55 - 75 lb. range (or more) when full grown. They are silly, happy, playful pups and their Mom still acts like a big puppy herself.

Olive is a special girl that was used as a breeding female in a puppy mill all her life. She came from there afraid of people and fearful of our touch. She has scars around her neck where a collar grew into her skin. She is comfortable with the other dogs and allows them to sleep near her and is even occasionally playful. More  recently, she has become more comfortable sharing a living space with humans. She is very curious about us and will follow us around the house observing our activities. She has begun to sleep on the bed near her foster family and started to allow them to pet her head. She is uncomfortable but never aggressive when picked up. Obvious progress has been made.       It is now time for Olive to meet and fall in love with her forever family. Her personality has began to show and she is a sweet and active little clown with the cutest little floppy ears ever and a pink tongue that always sticks out the side. She is doing well with the house training. She has success with going out doors to take care of business much of the time. She uses a fenced area she has never tried to escape from (not leashed). She prefers the safety of the house. Olives future family will definitely be rewarded with a happy and entertaining future with this sweetie! Olive has never been in love. Her heart is a blank slate. Will you be her first and forever love?      An adult puppy mill rescue needs another dog in the home to give them a level of comfort and model behavior. Please research some of the challenges associated with puppy mil dogs.       Olive is now spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm tested neg, flea/worm treated and she has been given a dental. Olive's adoption donation is $200.                
03/29/2016	Bela - Cane Corso Mastiff / Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Perry, NY	Female	Adult	"Posted Breed: Cane Corso Mastiff / Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (medium coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Winnie, who was adopted and renamed Bela was adopted for years and then returned starved and with a horrible skin condition. Bela is now in recovery with the rescue and hopes to find a home that will be committed to her for life and provide her the love and care she deserves.She has had a blood panel and heartworm/lyme testing done and all came back with no abnormalities or concerns.Bela is adjusting well to her foster home and although she hasn't met the other dogs she has really gotten more comfortable with her surroundings. 3-16-11: This wonderful, sweet puppy is with a litter of 5 gorgeous females that were turned in to GTTD rescue from a local WNY family that had an unplanned litter. They owned the Mom, a very sweet female brindle Pit Bull, and the Father was a neighbors male XL brindle Cane Corso Mastiff. - See more at: http://www.petango.com/Adopt/Dog-Terrier-American-Pit-Bull-12820416#sthash.2EDn0WNf.dpufAdoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

03/19/2016	Princess Peach - Pointer / Hound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Pointer-Unknown Mix	Tonawanda, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Pointer / Hound / Mixed (short coat). Hi! My name is Princess Peach - you may have noticed the tiara in my photos. I am a one year old pointer mix from North Carolina. I love playing with toys, especially nylabones and antlers. I enjoy being close to my foster family and will give as many kisses as you will allow me too. One of my favorite things to do is get belly rubs. I am house broken, crate trained and know how to “sit”. My foster family is teaching me something called “place”. I think it means I have to stay in one spot until they say otherwise. I don’t mind that one bit because I love to make them happy! Plus - it’s a great time to catch a quick nap. I’m a smart little girl if I do say so myself. I am currently living with two foster dog sisters. I am pretty good on a leash and continue to improve the more I practice. I would love to go for walks with you.   My foster family lets me run in their yard and I LOVE to run. I am looking for my forever family. Could that be you? Princesses adoption fee is $225.All dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered.

Please contact Dog (dogapplications@yahoo.com) for more information about this pet.  Meet Neroh! Neroh is a two-year-old pit mix who is very sweet and affectionate and he weighs approximately 60 pounds. He is house and crate trained, but he is not a big fan of the crate. Neroh has lived with both male and female dogs but would prefer having a female sister. He is not great with sharing his food and toys with other dogs, but does take correction from the female dog. As far as humans, the foster is able to put his hands near or in his food and take away toys with no problems. We were told that he lived with a five year old child in the past and absolutely adored him. He has lived with a cat but he didn't do well, therefore we would not recommend a house with cats. He would do best in a home that has good leadership and dog handling skills. A fenced in yard is also mandatory for his forever home!

Saved from the NYC kill shelter...  A volunteer writes: Coco is a gentle middle aged lady brought to us as her owner passed away…Her care has been very poor, almost non-existent and one wonders in which conditions both master and pet must have lived…Coco is skin and bones, her nails are very long, her eyes are cloudy, she seems to have been a mother many times and her skin is covered with sores of unclear nature that we are treating. Coco is shy but very sociable, low key and friendly with people and dogs alike. She comes right away to her door when called and is leashed in an instant. She walks nicely, does her business as we enter the yard and sits properly on command. She settles by my side, accepts a blanket on her shoulders, looks at me with the dearest eyes and rests for a while. She is extremely hungry but treats are limited so not to upset her stomach. She is such a sweet dog, happy with what she gets and does not get frustrated when I do not give her more food. It is like she understands without knowing that we want the best for her. She is trusting us…Coco is really a good girl, a good soul. It is about time that the wheel of fortune stops on the magic number that will land Coco a safe and stable home and the love of a master. Will you be Coco’s safe haven and the promise of a happy new beginning ?

03/19/2016	Georgia - Boxer / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer-Unknown Mix	Tonawanda, NY	Female	Adult	"Posted Breed: Boxer / Mixed (short coat). Hello there! My name is Georgia, and I am very pleased to be able to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a show-stopping (if I do say so myself...) 4 year old Boxer mix. All the nice folks at Buffalo Cares keep saying the nicest things about me, and my goodness it's enough to make a girl blush... My foster mom is always telling me that I'm ""as pretty as a peach"" and then she kisses me on my nose (which I really like - just don't tell foster mama that because she won't stop). I have to honestly also say that I am a very good cuddler and I adore just being near my favorite people. Even though I hesitate to brag here - because it is un-becoming for a lady - all of my friends at Buffalo Cares are always complimenting me on how well mannered I am; just like a real Soutern Belle! Why I've even been to ""finishing school"" . This fine finishing school is called K9 Connection, and it is one of the best training facilities for dogs in the whole wide world I think (and the nice teachers there say I can even keep coming to school after I find my forever home! How special is that?!) Because of this awesome training I can walk politely at your side on a leash, and I will stop and sit and look at you when you stop walking. Also, I know how to go to my ""place"" and wait there until you tell me to take a break; and I know how to sit, lay down, & take treats nicely just like a polite girl should. My closest friends have only 2 legs, and I would prefer to be the only 4-legged family member in my forever home please. And while I do adore people, I would do best with children over 10. I just love to be pampered and fussed over, and really I have so much love in me that I could fill even that whole big beautiful mansion called Tara from ""Gone With The Wind."" But I don't need a mansion to make me happy; I just need someone like you to love.....So what do y'all think? Could I be your very own little sip of Southern Comfort? I will keep your heart warm and bring a smile to your lips forever and ever so.....what are you waiting for? Apply for me today! Georgia's adoption fee is $225 + $50 training deposit that is refunded upon proof of completion of an obedience course. Georgia comes with free classes from K9 Connection.

Pleased to meet you! I am Petey! I am about 5 yrs old and am a Jack Russel Terrier Mix. I came to Buffalo CARES with my sister Polly when, sadly, my previous owner passed away. As you can tell by my pictures, I am an active little dude just like most JRTs. (Can you tell by my pictures – I am always on the move!) I love to run around the yard, going for walks, and chasing toys and balls. Don't worry though - I also love a great nap. I also like to hang out in the house, and browse out the windows to see who is doing what out there. My foster mom says sometimes I act more like a cat because I like to lay on the back of the couch and watch the world go by. I am housebroken and do pretty well in my crate but can get a little whiny, (but that’s because I’d prefer to be out with the folks or to be sleep in the bed!). I get along well with my canine and feline foster siblings. Prior to Buffalo CARES, I grew up in a home without kids and prefer the adult company right now. I do OK with those young ones, except they can get me a little riled up so I would do best with in a household that has children over 8 years old that can understand I sometimes need my space. I am looking for a new family to love me – will that be you?

03/19/2016	Hunter - Hound / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Tonawanda, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed (medium coat). Hello! My name is Hunter! I had a tragic route to Buffalo CARES. I was living as an outside dog at an Auto Shop where I found a hole in the fence and made my out to a busy intersection where, around Halloween, I was stuck by a car. I had several traumatic injuries including a bruised heart, collapsed lung, and fracture back leg. But, a nice volunteer saw me on the side of the road and rushed me to an emergency vet. I spent two weeks in the ICU and came up to Buffalo CARES on a rest and recovery stint. Fast forward to today and I am doing so well! I am perfecting my house manners. I was exposed to a home and kids in NC, but I was mostly an outdoor dog. However, I'd rather be an indoor dog these days! I can be a total couch potato and love to snuggle up to my people. I’m housebroken and know sit, down, and stay. I love my toys and to go for walks. I love to run around and play outside in the yard. The one thing is, though, I don’t love the crate – I get all nervous and jerky in there. But who needs a crate when I am a perfect gentleman when left out home alone. I don’t chew, bark or make a mess – the proof is in the security cameras that I just hang out on the couch all day! J I currently live with 3 foster sisters – two small old ladies and one rottie younger girl. My “big girl” foster sister and I love to play and then we crash out together on the couch for a nap. I get along well with all sisters, including respecting the two old gals who prefer to lounge than play. However, I am a no birds, bunnies, or rodents kind of guy. If you have children, I would prefer a home with older children – excitable kids make me nervous. Do you have room in your heart for a guy like me? Maybe even a current furbaby that might want a sibling and playmate? I’m a goofy, lovable, devoted, quirky, young boy looking for my forever home! Hunter's adoption fee is $225. Hunter will also go to his forever home with a 35lb. bag of dog food that was generously donated by TLC Pet Food.All dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered.

There's lots of me to love!Peanut was born February 1, 2007 and weighs WAY too much! We'll be working on that here, but you'll need to continue what we start and be sure she never gets this way again. She arrived truly looking like she was going to explode. She's such a nice little dog, but can be snippy with little kids which some of us can understand. She's fine with other dogs, house trained, good on leash and does need a leash because she may tend to wander. She does great in a car - loves rides. She is with us because her human is having major health issues on top of life issues.    Update from foster mom: Peanut is a sweet, gentle lady. She enjoys a warm cozy bed with blankets to curl up for a nap or just hang out. She likes her sweater(she is sensitive to the cold) Peanut likes other dogs and likes my teenagers. She weighs more than she should but she is working off that extra weight. She is good on the leash and enjoys going for short walks and car rides. Peanut needs someone to keep her active and make sure she continues her weight management efforts. Peanut is an awesome dog who deserves a wonderful home.

Well, not really, but he does have a great big giant personality. He is a Shih Tzu mix, and we estimate he is somewhere between 10 and 12 years of age.  (Harley was one of the two boys we had featured on our Facebook page along with Mugsey. They were not at all well cared for by their owners; then the owners passed away; and, after that, the relatives deserted Harley and Mugsey in the empty house to fend for themselves while they took the three younger pups in that household. NOT NICE AT ALL!!! Sadly, Mugsey did not survive… Luckily, Harley is safe and sound with us, thanks to our KY rescue partners.) As for personality, Harley is a delight!! He is a real character and as lovable as can be. He loves being outside and running with the big dogs, or inside curled up in a chair or in your lap. He is also potty trained. Harley is a wonderful little fella and will give his special someone more love, devotion and laughter then you can imagine. He is a very special active senior who has tons of life left in him and tons of love to give to his forever family.

03/19/2016	Rusty Frazer - Beagle / Foxhound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle-English Foxhound Mix	Cuba, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: Beagle / Foxhound / Mixed (short coat). Oh My, It's Chilly Up Here!!!!Rusty was born March 15, 2010 and weighs about 40 lbs. This cute little guy made his way up from North Carolina with Thanksgiving visitors that live in this area, they wanted to save him from the high kill pound in that area. Rusty is a timid guy that has absolutely no aggression, but little kids would make him nervous and he would benefit from having another dog in the home to guide him and be a companion.  He's good with cats and did great in the long ride here. He does need some leash work and is intimidated out in the world. He is going to be best in a rather quiet home with a fenced yard. Once he is comfortable in his surroundings you will forget that he is timid.. He is a sweet, very soft to the touch, lover boy just longing for that forever home. Rusty does have a slight limp on one front leg.   We found what we thought was an amazing home, with another of our dogs, and they took very good care of them for 2 1/2 years, but then they decided to move into another state and the home was smaller so the dogs became disposable. We always ask for our original vet care information when a dogs is returned and, ironically, they packed the medical records for the dogs that they were leaving behind and now they live on Dogwood Lance in another state. Alrighty then.....  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $150.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Thank you Manzella FamilyThe Manzella family, owner of 123 Shoes in Fairport, NY, held a fundraiser and brought in enough money to sponsor their SECOND life-saving transport! The lucky 17 saved on this trip from our friends at two shelters in Virginia and West Virginia! To the Manzella Family we just want to say ONE....TWO.... and... THREE Thank You(s)!!!   Mercy was born about _____ and weighs about 22 lbs. Joyful had mercy on her and her two surviving babies (Pasha & Kenda) and brought them north even knowing the ride would be hard on them, but after what they'd been through we couldn't leave them at the shelter to die, we had to try. With a big enough crate, near the heat vent, for the family of three and some food and water they survived and have flourished! Even though we are helping these two southern shelters routinely they are still running full and are trying so very hard to adopt what they have instead of killing them off to take in new dogs so they have created a waiting list.  Someone left a note saying they couldn't wait any longer on a box in the parking lot when the staff arrived to work finding Mercy, two pups that had frozen to death, and two more who were failing fast!  The staff acted quickly to warm and feed the babies and within a short time they did begin to nurse and haven't looked death in the eye since! They are social, fat, really funny little things and Mom is a pretty little brown girl that we have just no idea of breed so we've guessed as well as we can. She is happy and loving life and we are so glad she made the journey and safely!  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $300.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

We just received an urgent call for help from a partner shelter, this baby was just brought in after being shot in the face. The bullet is still logged in his j ... aw, and the jaw is shattered. We are sick that anyone could do such a pure evil act of cruelty to an innocent creature. Neighbors say, a car stopped in front of the house where Magic was tied out in front of, and they just started shooting up the house and also shot Magic in the face. Magic has officially been signed over so he can receive the medical care that he desperately needs. We have accepted Magic into SCRNYC and he is enroute to our emergency vet for treatment. We need to ask you for your help, please consider making a donation for his medical care. We know he will need surgery to repair his jaw, and time to recover from this horrific injury. Go to www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/donate The cops who came to help get Magic to the shelter, could not believe how docile he was, even being in extreme pain. They are looking for the men who shot up the house, we pray they are found, and justice is served.

Hi everyone - Myles here, wonderful to meet you! I am a super sweet and sensitive fellow and I am looking for my forever home. Life didn't start out on easy street for me before I came to Buffalo Cares; I was living in a sanctuary because I had no home. There were lots of dogs there but not many people, and so it takes me a little time to get to know people and be comfortable with them. I am always well mannered with people, and never ever a bad boy - I just take a little bit of time to warm up to new people and learn that I can trust them. My foster mom says I have the most beautiful warm eyes that sometimes just brim over with the love and joyful spirit that is inside of me (my foster mom is too kind but I like that she said that). I love to wiggle my whole body when I get excited and see my people or other dogs. And I think my most perfect forever home would be awesome if there was another dog there that could help me continue to learn to really trust and relate to people. I love to go for walks and sniff all the interesting smells that the world has to offer, and I love to sunbathe! Inside of me, just waiting to come out, is a happy and fun loving dog that's just aching to find a family that will give me a chance to break out of my shell....just need someone to really give me a chance....Could that special someone be you?   Myles' adoption fee is $175 + $50 training deposit that is refunded upon proof of completion of an obedience course.    Myles will also go to his forever home with a 35lb. bag of dog food that was generously donated by TLC Pet Food.     All dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered.

03/18/2016	Kirk Cousins - Hound / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Brooklyn, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed. Like his namesake, Kirk Cousins has a heart of gold and serious love for dogs. In canine Kirk's case, however, that dog love got him into a spot of trouble, as he followed another pooch straight to a Florida kill shelter!

Ki rk's a young chap around 1 to 2 years old and 37 pounds. He's cratetrained, good on a leash, and friendly with both other dogs and people. Everyone who's met him says that Kirk's pure sweetness.

He is calm, fantastic on leash, seemingly housebroken, cratetrained, and he loves napping and cuddling. He's super happy to  be a lap dog and accompany his humans just about anywhere. Around 14 pounds, he can easily do so! While he gets along with other polite pups (and would probably be fine with a cat, though not officially tested), Jimmy's really more interested in being the people's Presidawg. He's estimated to be about 5 years old, neutered, UTD on vaccinations, and microchipped. He is not just peanuts! Visit www.badassbk.com for an application to foster or adopt.

03/18/2016	Hope - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Garden City, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat). Meet Hope! Hope was rescued from the Chatham County Animal Shelter while heavily pregnant, in December of 2015. She whelped 9 beautiful puppies on Dec. 9, most of whom have been adopted into loving homes.   Hope is a sweet, loving girl who, in typical ACD fashion, wants nothing more than a person to call her own. She is a strong and energetic dog, embodying typical ACD traits and would make an ideal hiking, biking or running partner. Hope also shows alot of drive and could easily excel in obedience or agility type work. Her ideal person will lead an active lifestyle.   Hope currently lives with 3 other dogs and although she is less fond of small dogs, she is doing well with her pack, which includes a chihuahua. As long as proper introductions and initial supervision is observed, Hope should have no problem living with most any other dogs. Due to her having had to fend for herself for the first part of her life, Hope does have a high prey drive for small animals such as rabbits and chickens, so would do best in a home without other small animals. She has been around horses and does just fine with them.   As a young dog, and true to ACD nature, Hope can be independent and will need an owner who is capable of exhibiting firm boundaries and leadership. She responds very well to positive reinforcement training methods. Hope currently lives in a home with 5 older children and would be best suited for a home with kids ages 8 and above.   With a committed owner who is willing to give her time and consistent training and leadership, she will develop into a truly amazing dog and partner. Hope is mostly house trained and crate trained. She walks well on a leash. Hope weighs 36 lbs and is HW negative, UTD on vaccines, spayed and microchipped.   Hope is being fostered in Apex, NC   EMAIL QUESTIONS TO: luvamigo@bellsouth.net                
03/18/2016	Coco - Shepherd / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Perry, NY	Female	Baby	"Posted Breed: Shepherd / Mixed (short coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Coco and her sister Claire arrived recently and are tiny little bugs still. They are less than 8lbs at 11wks old. We are a little unsure of what breed makeup they really are so this is the best guess we have. They are your typical young puppy, a blank canvas of curiosity that will need a positive family that has the desire to bond and make her a wonderful companion. Coco has already been spayed, shes vaccinated and will receive the rest of her vaccines as she gets old enough. She is also microchipped and was fecal tested negative. Her adoption fee is $300 which covers all of the above medical care received.Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home.

03/18/2016	Luna - American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Perry, NY	Female	Baby	"Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org   Luna can be shy at first but a quite a feisty pup once she's engaged. She plays hard and naps just as hard but that's pretty typical for a 9 week old pup. Tug is her favorite game but she will chase anything that moves. She is much less vocal than her brother Loki who likes to hog the spotlight. She snuggles like a champ and is already starting to pick up some basics like sit. She loves treats, especially a bit of chicken or cheese. Give her a snack and her shy demeanor melts away into a playful and spunky little pup. She loves playing with the big dogs and is very respectful when meeting new friends. Luna's adoption fee is $250 to cover the expenses of spay, microchip, dewormers, and vaccinations.Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home.

03/18/2016	Winnie - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Garden City, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat). Hi my name is Winnie! I'm a spunky little 2/3 year old girl. I'm 35lbs, but I'm overweight. I'm small like a Corgie. I just got done with Heartworm treatment, so I haven't been able to exercise as I should. I'm such a love! I just love to snuggle and be where my humans are. I love to play with my foster sister. I walk well on leash, but best with a gentle leader harness! I'm house trained, although I've had a few accidents when my foster parents were still learning my potty signs. I won't ring the bell like my foster sister does. I just sit by the door and wait until someone notices me. I'm okay with cats. My foster cat sister is very sensitive. She runs away from me and hides. If I see her over the gate I do bark at her. If I see her in the bathroom closet, I leave her alone.  I get along well with my foster sister, but do have some jealousy issues. My foster sister deals with me well, but I would probably love being an only dog. So, I can have all the love and attention to myself! With the right dog, I might be okay. I've met kids a few times. If they stay calm, I stay calm. I'll also cuddle with them on the couch. They just shouldn't tease me with toys or food. When new people come into the house, I'm a little protective and bark a lot . Once they give me a treat I settle down. I love my crate. I sprint to it every morning when it is time for my foster mom to go to work. I just lay in my bed in my crate and enjoy the frozen peanut butter treat she gives me. I've never had an accident in it or destroyed anything in it. I know sit, paw, and down (with a treat).  I love to eat the healthy fruits and veggies my foster mom gives me to try! I do like to guard my toys or anything I pick up off the ground that might interest me. I am easily coaxed away with a treat though. I do not guard my food bowl. Since I just completed Heartworm treatment and tested negative, I haven't had much outdoor experience (due to exercise restriction). I do like being able to run around out in the yard and sniff around. I must have someone who will love me and be patient with me. I would probably benefit from basic training as well. I will need to have my heartworm retested at the end of July. Don't you just want to snuggle me?

She underwent a successful surgery to repair her broken leg. She is did very well in recovery and is now looking for a loving forever home to call her own. Despite her horrendous past, she is a very sweet, friendly girl. Cindy Lou does not let her little limp get in the way of making every single day the best one of her life. Oct. 1, 2015: We are horrified by the abuse and neglect that we see on a daily basis. We were just contacted by a kill shelter about a throw-away momma dog who was found on a road screaming in pain. The animal control rushed out after neighbors heard her cries for help. When they arrived they found Cindy Lou in the street and literally screaming in pain. It appears she was thrown out of a car, according to some reports from the neighbors who have not seen a dog like her in their area before. This happened overnight and it is unknown if she sustained her injuries from being thrown from the car at a high speed or if she was run over on purpose. We are horrified by the information we were given by the shelter. Cindy- Lou is in desperate need of medical care, and rescue. The shelter also reports that she is full of milk, and that there has to be puppies somewhere who need their momma. We are just beside ourselves for the thought of the fate of her puppies looks grim right now. The shelter has sent another officer to scour the area for her babies. According to the shelter they know she already has 1 broken leg, and possible internal injuries. Time is of the essence to get her to a emergency hospital for treatment. We desperately need your help! We can not take on such a severe medical care without funds for her medical care. We have 2 dogs in emergency care right now for pneumonia. Please help us to be able to rescue Cindy-Lou and get her the critical care that she needs. Donations are desperately needed and greatly appreciated. Www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/donate Cindy is only about a year old, and deserves a second chance.                
03/18/2016	Gunner - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Flushing, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel. Emergency new home needed for Gunner! This black beauty originally came to us from the Brooklyn shelter where he was brought in as a stray and was later adopted. Unfortunately, Gunner has been exhibiting some anxiety while in the home and tends to be protective of the one he loves, a combination that has caused him to be fearful and act out. As a result, we are desperately looking for a more suitable home for Gunner, preferably with a single adult with no other pets who has experience and is willing to work with Gunner on his issues. We believe with the right home, Gunner can learn to trust again and flourish. Handsome Gunner is neutered, microchipped, up to date on all his shots, and heartworm negative. He will be professionally groomed before going to his new home with a new leash and collar set.

I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do.

Hello, my name is Paris I am a beautiful girl full of unconditional love and affection. I was pulled from a high kill shelter when I was in danger of losing my life just as I was about to have all my beautiful babies. My babies just recently celebrated their 1st Birthday! They are doing amazing and all have homes. I want the same for me. My very own forever home. I am house trained and have NEVER had an accident in the house. I also have house manners and don’t chew on anythi ng other than the toys and stuffed animals I am given. I enjoy going for walks, riding in the car and hanging out with people. My favorite game to play is fetch – how I LOVE to play fetch! I have always been very social and there isn’t a person I don’t like. Children are especially fun and warm to cuddle with. I also think cats are awesome. My foster family has grown very attached to me and would actually prefer to keep me; however, I don’t do well with other dogs – which is tough in a foster environment. In fact, it’s my only struggle, other dogs. I need to be the only dog in my new home and hope that this one little thing won’t prevent my new family from finding me. If you would like more information about me feel free to contact my foster mom, she can’t stop bragging about me and would be happy to answer your questions! http://www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/app-form                
03/18/2016	Duke Paladino - Terrier / Fox Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Cuba, NY	Male	Baby	"Posted Breed: Terrier / Fox Terrier / Mixed. The James Patrick ""Paladino"" Transport! Duke was born about January 9, 2016 and is the pup of our Grace. As for breed Grace has very distinct, tiny, ears, so I'm going with a Fox Terrier mix with emphasis on mix! Grace weighs about 20 lbs. and is a little love! We have no clue who the father was so these pups may be smaller or larger than Grace. Please don't let this major cuteness judge your good common sense. If you are looking for something specific, including size, then these pups may not be for you. They are a surprise package!  This transport is in honor and loving memory of our nephew, Patrick James Paladino, who passed away suddenly at the young age of 29. He was a devilish sort of boy, with a smile that would take your breath away and one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen. His sidekick and best friend, Duke, an American Staffordshire Bulldog, went everywhere with Patrick and the bond they shared was incredible. Duke now can be see everywhere with Patrick's father, Carl and is a permanent fixture on any of the couches in the Ellicott Square offices.  Many years ago a small, white dog ""supposedly"" followed Pat home from school. He begged his mother to let him keep him; she did. He named him Buttons and had him for years. This is one of my favorite stories about Pat, as I feel he rescued this dog long before Animal Rescues ever existed.  Joe and I chose rescue as our way to honor Patrick.  We can see him smiling as this wonderful rescue is about to take place in his name. We also felt we wanted to mention the three humans whose lives were also saved due to his parents selfless act of choosing organ donation.   Patrick, your nieces and nephews are very excited about this and have already picked out names. So let this journey begin and load up this truck, with your spirit protecting and guiding our precious transporters to where the once abandoned and abused will be rescued and cared for, until that special soul comes along that will give them their second chance at life, their forever home and most of all, love, just like you did that day you rescued Buttons so many years ago. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $400.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.    Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.   YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES    We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list.

03/18/2016	Liam - American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Perry, NY	Male	Baby	"Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Liam is definitely the mama’s boy of his litter! Although he likes to play with dogs he’s comfortable with, big or small, he’s usually the first to take a break from the action and observe from the arms of the nearest person. Chewing and wrestling are his preferred activities; he hasn’t shown much interest in chasing balls or playing tug-of-war, and he’s learning to be respectful of the resident cats. He’s a sweet, affectionate puppy who absolutely loves to snuggle, and he’s looking for someone who will commit to positive training and help him build his confidence. Liam's adoption fee is $250 which covers the cost of neuter, vaccines, dewormers, and microchip.  *Please note, no invisible fencing will be allowed*Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

Up for adoption is a boy who will make your heart feel all fuzzy! Fuzz is just remarkable! He had scarring on his face/nose from being tied or taped somehow, and also has scarring from an embedded collar. (all skin of both areas completely healed). Fuzz does not hold any kind of grudge, he just loves people! Due to his size, I would suggest no small children bc he will knock them over. He is a giant mush, loves belly rubs and cuddling on the couch. He is crate trained a nd completely housebroken. Knows basic commands (sit, gives paw, lie down) and is very treat motivated! Loves to go for walks, and is learning his leash manners. He is friendly on walks and loves to meet everyone. He has been fantastic with both male and female dogs, friendly and playful. Had minor resource guarding the first few days we had him, but has not shown any in the last few months. Loves to run around and play outside, so he would definitely need a yard, with a high fence. For a big boy, he is pretty agile and can scale/climb baby gates with ease. He has the true personality of a Mastiff - a big goof ball/gentle giant. He truly is a mush, just wants to be loved! This big boy will need an experienced handler or an adopter who will be willing to join him in a fun, basic handling training session.

Spencer is a 1 year old smart, goofy, lab mix who was rescued from a small rural shelter in NC where he was set to be euthanized. He came to us severely emaciated and neglected but has thrived in his foster home. He is still a puppy at heart – at times jumpy, mouthy and wants to be the center of attention, but he responds well to corrections and is eager to learn. He has improved with his potty training and learned sit within an hour of being in his foster home. He is not the biggest fan of a crate but will settle down after a few minutes of whining and some barking. His foster home is working on basic obedience as well as getting him used to his crate. He does great sleeping in his crate at night without much fuss or any accidents. He gets along well with dogs, cats and kids. He is very playful and will benefit from being in a home with another dog that will play with him regularly. Spencer is best described as a lab with Great Dane tendencies, as he has the longest legs that he trips over in his exuberance to play. Spencer has not had the best life, he is unsure of human touch but enjoys being pet once he knows that he is not going to be hurt. He is slowly gaining much needed weight but still has a ways to go as he was not fed regularly as evidenced by his appearance. Spencer is neutered, up-to-date and microchipped. He is ready to find his forever home

03/18/2016	Jenna Princeton - Pit Bull Terrier / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Labrador Retriever Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Saved on my last Week of Life! Jenna was born about January 27, 2013 and weighs about 45 lbs. Jenna's color and pattern is beyond gorgeous. Though she is a young adult, Jenna still has a lot of puppy spirit left and is very inquisitive about everything.  She is very athletic and can play fetch all day so get your throwing arm ready. She has a very fun and playful (not hyper) personality. She needs an active family and lots of running room to keep her happy. She can jump a 4 foot fence so a 6 foot fence will be needed. She received some initial obedience training at Canine Academy in Clarence giving her a great head start and we would love for her new home to continue to work with her. She is very eager to please, responsive & food motivated. She is crate trained, knows sit, wait, and let go and does a really good job of coming when called. Jenna has been living in a foster home with other dogs, but we've learned that interacting with her fellow canines can be a tricky area for her. Some days she behaves great with playing chase and give & take with toys. Other times, she exhibits bad manners such as ""pester barking"" at a dog that has something she wants or plays too rough and pounces on others. She can be selective about who she likes (strange dogs) and can be resource protective. So, we think being the only dog is the home would be best unless you are willing to work on a very slow introduction with another pet to build and encourage pack bonding and be able to supervise playtime. She is quite wiggly and may knock a toddler down, so a home with older kids would be better. She does have strong prey drive which is great for fetching but not so much for cat or rodent pets. She is very affectionate and wonderful with people so it's easy to forgive her other vices. Patience and tolerance at her new home will be important.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $125.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet.

They are very easy going and quiet in the home and are not incessant barkers as long as they are together. They eat, walk and sleep together. They are housebroken and crate trained. They don't like alot of excitement as they get nervous around young kids/toddlers running around and grabbing them. They would be best in a home with older kids ages 10 yrs + or with an active retired person or couple that can spend alot of time with them. Since they are quiet, they would be suitable for an apt but they are used to a home with a fenced in yard. They deserve to be the center of attention and spoiled rotten!! Pls come meet/ adopt them today! For more info/app; pls send your PHONE# via email to: CECE@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG

Andrea Harrison is an approximately 1 year old shepherd/husky mix who's a long, lean (underweight) 45 pounds. Her sweetness made her a staff favorite at the Florence-Lauderdale Animal Shelter, where they begged us to save her life for being so good. Andrea is shy initially and can take a little time to trust, but investing in getting to know her well worth the effort. Once you've bonded, she ""love s big!!"" and proves to be both goofball and sweetheart. Andrea gets along famously with other dogs and cats, is housebroken, and has been working hard on her training skills. Andrea is currently undergoing treatment for blastomycosis (non-contagious fungal infection), but would love to go home with a Badass family who'll see it through. Andrea is spayed, UTD on vaccinations, and microchipped. To foster or adopt, please visit our website at www.badassbk.com for an application.                "

Black Friday means something very different for a small rural shelter than it does for the rest of America. You see, every Friday is Black Friday. It is the day... that the ""rescue van"" gets filled up with shelter animals and makes its way here to the Northeast to deliver these animals to rescue organizations. Unfortunately for the animals who are not fortunate to get selected by rescues, it means the end of the road, death for them. There simply aren't enough resources, funds for vet care, open foster homes, adopters, for the rescues to save every single one. The lives of 3 six month old puppies hangs in the balance right now. These 3 puppies have been held as evidence in a cruelty case since they were six weeks old!! They were locked up in a crate without food and water in 100 degree temperatures. Well, they are now released and only have a few hours to find placement with a rescue or they will be euthanized. We would love to take all of them, but we simply do not have the resources to take all 3. We need your help. Sadie, Sam and Sal, have only known life behind bars. They desperately deserve to be cherished family pets. Please help us to save them!! - we need foster homes who can take a puppy into your home by tomorrow. Please go to www.nycsecondchancerescue.org to fill out an application. -if you can not foster, you can donate to help with their vetting at www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/donate -if you can't foster or donate- please share this post!!

03/18/2016	Buttons Paladino - Retriever / Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Cuba, NY	Female	Baby	"Posted Breed: Retriever / Terrier / Mixed (short coat). The James Patrick ""Paladino"" Transport! Buttons Paladino was born about November 27, 2015 and may top out in the 50 lb. range, but we are just guessing. Right before we were ready to pull out of the shelter parking lot they received a call that a woman was going to bring in two Golden Retriever pups that her 82 year old Grandma couldn't handle (big surprise) and could we wait for her?  Sure! Another 20 minutes later we are packing up Buttons and PJ for a long ride north and we sure are glad we waited!  They surely aren't Golden Retriever pups, but we love them anyway and so will you!  This transport is in honor and loving memory of our nephew, Patrick James Paladino, who passed away suddenly at the young age of 29. He was a devilish sort of boy, with a smile that would take your breath away and one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen. His sidekick and best friend, Duke, an American Staffordshire Bulldog, went everywhere with Patrick and the bond they shared was incredible. Duke now can be see everywhere with Patrick's father, Carl and is a permanent fixture on any of the couches in the Ellicott Square offices.  Many years ago a small, white dog ""supposedly"" followed Pat home from school. He begged his mother to let him keep him; she did. He named him Buttons and had him for years. This is one of my favorite stories about Pat, as I feel he rescued this dog long before Animal Rescues ever existed.  Joe and I chose rescue as our way to honor Patrick.  We can see him smiling as this wonderful rescue is about to take place in his name. We also felt we wanted to mention the three humans whose lives were also saved due to his parents selfless act of choosing organ donation.   Patrick, your nieces and nephews are very excited about this and have already picked out names. So let this journey begin and load up this truck, with your spirit protecting and guiding our precious transporters to where the once abandoned and abused will be rescued and cared for, until that special soul comes along that will give them their second chance at life, their forever home and most of all, love, just like you did that day you rescued Buttons so many years ago. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $375.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet.

According to his foster mom Jake has the most beautiful bluish/greyish eyes and big goofball, he likes to play all day long. He is good with other dogs of his size or larger; he lives with German shepherd and another Pitbull and is very respectful of both. Small dogs as well as cats might not be a good idea as he thinks they are toys to play and might unintentionally hurt them.Capitan has been going to professional training and has been in a group with 10 or more dogs and plays well with all. He is crate trained and house trained and never had accidents in the house. He loves people; his favorite thing is to snuggle on a couch or a bed with his human. He walks well on a leash and knows sit, shake stay, and his favorite command is to come, when he hears the command he gets so happy that somebody is calling him and runs as fast as he can. He also likes to walk on a treadmill if somebody offers him a treat for it.The perfect family for Jake is one that has time to continue to enforce his training and make sure he gets enough exercise. No cats or small dogs please and children middle school age or older.

Please contact Nancy (dunnpb61@msn.com) for more information about this pet.This is Penny!! She is about 18 months old, and a sweetheart! I pulled her from the shelter right before they were killing. She is a wonderful, active girl who needs an active person or family. The more I get to know her, the more I thought she was definitely lab (she loves to collect our items!) but something else. I think she has a lot of Vizsla in her. Her energy level points to that, as does her temperment.  Penny has a loving, friendly temperament. She loves everyone and everything - dogs, cats, kids, people! She is about 50 pounds and is already spayed, has all her shots and is ready for your home. She was food protective of her food with the other dogs, but we have been working on that, and she is 99.9% better about it as she realizes that food is always available here. Still, she needs to go to a family who will continue working with her on this and I wouldn't adopt her to anyone with very young children, as I haven't seen her with toddlers near her food and I don't now if she would see a very young child as human or part of her pack.  Penny needs to go to an active family, couple or single. This is not a couch potato dog. If you are looking for a hiking partner, a swimming buddy or a running buddy, she would be perfect for you. She would be fine with a family who would take her with them, but please don't consider her if you crate your dog while you work, and then when you go out after work. This would be a terrible life for her.  If you can give Penny the life she deserves, please email me at dunnpb61@msn.com for an application. Thank you for considering a rescue dog.

Krystal (purple bandana) was protected by her sister Willa (white bandana). Both were found, emaciated and with a severe case of mange, left to the elements and packs of stray dogs, to fend for themselves. Willa loved Krystal so much that she became used to wrapping herself around her like a blanket. This is how they were found. Willa is approximately 9 months old and currently weighs 26 pounds. She is very sweet and would be the perfect companion for most homes. She is good with other dogs and all people. We would like her and her sister to go to the same family as we believe they may be bonded. What does that mean? It means they are so very close with each other that they rely on each other heavily and would have a hard time apart. If you can open your home to these sweet sisters and give them unconditional love and support, please apply here.

03/18/2016	Mick - Shepherd / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Tonawanda, NY	Male	Young	"Posted Breed: Shepherd / Mixed (medium coat). G’day mates! Mick here – so pleased to meet you and I’m grateful to have a chance to tell you more about myself! I’m an almost two year old Shepherd mix. My foster mom says that I am like that cool and suave actor Mick Dundee in the Crocodile Dundee movies. He’s handsome, smart and had to learn how to survive and how to live. My life so far has been like the journey in the movie……. I have come a long way in my short life. I ended up in a shelter as young pup for some reason – my family just couldn’t keep me anymore. There I was in a loud, scary place that terrified me. That is where my journey began – but don’t worry, this story has a happy ending – I hope you’ll keep reading! I was pulled out of the shelter by some wonderful rescue angels. At the time, I felt like I needed to take care of myself – I had learned to fend for myself and it would take me time to learn to trust humans. I have since moved in to Buffalo C.A.R.E.S. Animal Rescue where I am on my journey to being the best guy I can be! I was much more comfortable around other dogs, and the people there gave me time to settle in and to see that they would keep me safe and take care of me. We started going on walks with other dogs and I really liked that, and I started to understand that people were ok and that they make the rules - and that that was totally cool! All I had to do was sit and walk next to them and do other things like lay down or touch their hand with my nose and they would give me a really tasty treat! These nice people kept saying I was in training but I think we were now just traveling on my journey together. That is when I started to trust, and to like being with people. I got lots of treats, and went for car rides and pack walks, went to the beach and on trails with trees and grass, and all kinds of cool stuff - AND I was happy! With my foster mom and the nice people at BCares and the kennel, I have continued on my walkabout - and now the end of that journey is almost in sight. I am ready to go home; I just need someone very special to help me find the end of this winding road. I need someone who will give me a quiet home without a lot of new people and stuff going on - especially at first. It will take me some time to learn about you, and to trust & respect you; then I will be your lifelong friend (or ""mate"" like they say in Australia where my hero Mick Dundee lived)....Please help me find the end of my long walkabout journey - we can walk together off to the happy forever I have been dreaming of. Mick's adoption fee is $225.All dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered.

Roscoe has come a long way since he joined the PMAR family in January! We just had to save this puppy, who had clearly been starved and then abandoned at Brooklyn ACC with a broken femur. He underwent emergency surgery, which saved his leg, then went home with an experienced foster mom for recovery and lots of love.  It's been just about 2 months, Roscoe is in a PA foster home and is now ready to start looking for a forever family of his own. He is a healthy, happy boy, who enjoys playing with his canine foster siblings. He has very nice leash manners and is crate trained. Roscoe has learned ""sit"", and how to take treats politely. He is an active boy, who is also affectionate and loves to cuddle.   Roscoe is now about 6 months old, 45 lbs. and he still has quite a bit of growing to do! Roscoe would do best in a home with another friendly dog. He hasn't met any cats, so he would need an owner who is comfortable doing dog/cat introductions.

Thank You Anne's Friend !!!“This transport was funded in celebration of the life of Anne by one of her high school classmates in Wellsville. Anne was a Springer lover and a school psychologist in Rochester. Anne died a young, and tragic, death and her friends were kept from her bedside by family. The transport sponsor felt this was a wonderful way to honor Anne.”   Celeste Anne was born about November 18, 2015 and may top out in the 15-20 lb. range when full grown. She is lively, funny, happy, and just full of life! So glad we were able to save this tiny being. Perhaps it's because these pups have gone hungry, but they take treats from hands with a little too much zest so no little kids.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $400.00.

My name's Eddie, (Eddie Spaghetti) and I'm a stunning pointer/terrier mix who made a very special trip from the Bahamas to find a safe home here in WNY! Life didn’t start off great, and I lived outside tied to a car. Even so, I love to cuddle and be by foster mom’s side. I also love playing in a fenced yard, am crate trained, and house trained. My favorite toys are kongs, cow hooves, and my stuffed frog. I love to go for walks and sniff all the interesting smells that the world has to offer. I tend to be a quiet companion, just hanging out. I'm loyal and will go with you wherever you go. My favorite place is to be by my human’s side. I prefer my humans over the age of 13yrs, as little children make me nervous. I'm an independent guy and would do just fine as an only dog but if you've already got a furry friend, I'd be happy to meet them to see if we'd be a match. I’m aching to have a furever family who is patient and willing to continue to show me what life in a home is like - I am hoping it is you! WARNING: you might just fall in love with my green eyes. Eddie's adoption fee is $225 + $50 training deposit that is refunded upon proof of completion of an obedience course.All dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered.

Chu ... ck is now at NYCACC, municipal shelter. He was taken from his home, after his subhuman ""owners"" abandoned him in a empty house and moved away, leaving Chuck locked inside for weeks, alone, scared, and without food and water. Weeks went by and Chuck became desperate, so he started to eat the carpets and a bottle of cooking oil. One day the mailman was walking past the house and noticed Chuck in the broken window, about to jump out. She called to him, and thankfully he listened to her. Animal control came and took him away. Chuck needs our help to walk out of the shelter alive! We would LOVE to help him, he received a great evaluation, all good scores. Neighbors report him as being a sweet friendly dog. Please we need a foster, adopted to step up to save his life! Please go to www.nycsecondchancerescue.org to fill out an application.

03/08/2016	Lola - American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Perry, NY	Female	Adult	"Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Lola is a recent intake who gave birth to 4 puppies so she will not be available for adoption until after March 5th. Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

Please contact Jeannie (toomanyshepherds@aol.com) for more information about this pet.This is a courtesy listing for our friends at the ASPCA. If interested, please contact Dara directly at dara.ruiz@aspca.org Hi there! My name is Caitlyn. In the spring of 2014, I was rescued by NYC law enforcement from a cruelty/neglect case, where I was found living in a car with my littermates. I was immediately transferred to the ASPCA’s hospital and adoption center. In January of 2015, I was transferred to the Behavioral Rehabilitation Center at St. Hubert’s, where I learned that unfamiliar people, objects, sounds and real-life situations aren’t as scary as I thought. I graduated from the Rehab Center program in June. I might take a little bit of time to come out of my shell, but once I do, I’m a very sweet, gentle dame who will love to keep you company. I’ll do best with a patient, experienced adopter—someone willing to help me along as I continue to learn new things and discover the world. I am looking for an experienced adopter with a quiet household, and at least one confident doggie housemate. I also get along with cats. A fenced yard where I can sunbathe in the warmer weather would be a huge plus! I’ve made many new friends at the Rehab Center, but I’m still shy around unfamiliar people. Please give me time to warm up at my own pace. When I meet new people, ask them to toss me pieces of my kibble. When I’m more comfortable, they can ask me to hand target for kibble. I do best when I meet people in the presence of a confident dog friend. I’m ready to learn, but I don’t know many obedience skills yet! The Rehab Center staff focused on reducing my fear, not on teaching me how to do things like sit, lie down and come when called. (I definitely don’t know that last one yet, so be sure not to let me off-leash!) Taking me to an obedience class that uses reward-based training (no punishment, please) would be a great way to build our bond. We know with a special person, Caitlyn will be the perfect companion. Please contact Dara at dara.ruiz@aspca.org An application process will be required.Please complete our online Adoption Application. It is the first step toward bringing home your new family member.

03/08/2016	Hercules - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Savannah, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Look at this strapping young man! Hercules truly has a story to melt anyone's heart! At just 5 years old he is looking for his forever home. Hercules is an energetic young man that is still learning his manners. His front legs are deformed but that doesn't slow him down at all! He still enjoys running and playing just as any other dog! As Hercules gets older it is likely that he will develop arthritis in his front legs and is currently on joint supplements to slow the progression. He does do well with slower introductions to other dogs but would do best in a home without cats or young children.                
03/08/2016	Loddy - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Garden City, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed (short coat). Eyes are the windows of the soul, and Loddy’s beautiful brown eyes reflect what an incredibly sweet, loving girl she is. This pretty spayed female is about 8 years young and 40 lbs. Loddy is a happy, funny character that will bring smiles into any home. She is a Velcro girl, and wants nothing more than to be close to her special people. Because Loddy was abandoned in boarding while heartworm positive, she was kenneled for many months. Through several courses of treatment, she was medically restricted from exercise. Loddy recently completed her final treatment, and has been excited to get out and go for walks again. She walks well on a leash, and isn’t a puller. She loves tug-of-war and chewing on toys. She’s also more than happy just to hang out and snuggle. She crates well, and sits nicely for treats and dinner. Loddy has been very accepting of all humans, and seems to have a soft spot for small children. She’s done well with dogs of all sizes and energy levels-- including a 7-pound Yorkie mix--and respects cats.  Loddy’s heartworm infection is under control now, and she’s up to date with vaccinations and preventatives. She has elbow dysplasia, which means she can fold her front legs into amazing yoga-like positions. Neither the dysplasia nor a touch of arthritis seems to bother Loddy too much, though they give her an unusual rocking gait, and going down steps is a bit more challenging for her. This girl has so much love to offer. She will be a devoted companion for a family with respectful children, or a retiree or individual working from home. Loddy is being fostered in Pittsburgh, PA.

Cara American Pit Bull Terrier Mix Adult • Female • Medium 3 years old ~ 55 lbs UTD on vaccinations ~ spayed ~ microchipped Located in Langhorne, PA About Cara: Cara's foster mom says Cara is a great dog that loves everyone she meets! She also loves to be with people. She loves them so much , that she needs to sleep with you on the bed. She loves car rides( make sure you don’t put the window down too low or she will jump out.) She also loves to chew on her bones when she is not running around or playing fetch. She also loves her fruits and veggies. Her favorites are apples, peaches, bananas and carrots. She is afraid of water, so don’t expect her to go swimming. Cara is good with strangers and some dogs. She is housebroken and crate trained and walks nicely on a leash. She knows her sit, stay and lay down commands. She also knows her “drop it “ command when playing ball. Cara's perfect forever family is one that is active and will have the time to make sure she gets plenty of exercise. Due to the fact that she can play a little rough, children middle school age or older. Intros would need to be made to make sure she would get along with a doggie sibling.

PeeWee's foster mom says he is the easiest guy! With a medium energy level and the ability to keep himself amused, combined with the fact that he is non-destructve when being left alone, he is a dream dog. He loves giving LOTS of kisses and spending time with his family. He has the funniest personality to match his goofy ears.  PeeWee is a little shy when meeting new people but he quickly warms up and wants to make friends. He is good with most dogs with proper introductions. He doesn't like being in a crate but is very well behaved when being left alone. He is housebroken and walks nicely on a leash although he prefers hanging out in the backyard over going for a walk.  PeeWee's perfect forever family is one that has a yard for him to romp around in and has some experience with terriers. Children junior high age or older as he can be a little timid. Doggie siblings would be fine but introductions would be needed to ensure that they are a good match.

Further information, applications and available pets can be found at http://www.rescued-treasures.comOdo is a 7 year old cocker spaniel mix, who weighs about 44 pounds. His back end was hit by a car in September of 2015 that caused fractures and nerve damage. He lost some strength in his hind legs and became incontinent. His vet was hoping he will improve his muscle functions through daily exercise trainings. His previous owner was not able to spend enough time to help him, so he came to Rescued Treasures to find his special family who will continue to assist him for his journey of recovery and his care. He is a low key dog that loves to be with people. He is good with most dogs, ignores cats but would hunt small critters. He is mobile around the house by scooting or dragging his hind legs. He was fitted for a cart to assist him going on walks outdoors. Most of the time he wears belly bands or diapers. He prefers someone to be home a lot, who is able to lift some weight to help him stand. And a house with open space for him to move around and not too many steps to get in and out.

03/08/2016	Romeo - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	New York, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Romeo deserves to be in foster or forever home as soon as possible. This lab mix boy is up to date on shots and nuetered. He received professional training simply because he was young, jumped a lot and needed basic command training and work on leash. We asked our trainer for a bio, and this is what he says ""Romeo is food motivated (in a good way), active, loves to play fetch, and is good with other dogs his size. He has been with kids as young as 5 and did very well on leash, taking treats gently. Romeo is crate trained, and should be in crate when 'unsupervised'. He is housetrained but will pee in crate if left too long..he is a vocal boy when he plays or is trying to tell you he needs to potty. He knows basic commands, and loves the beach! Romeo is not a fan of small critters like snakes, squirrels, chipmunks, toads. He survived being bitten by a poisonous snake last year. Romeo loves to go for walks and does very well in pack walks that he takes weekly, and has never met a person he does not love. He rides well in the car, a little nervous at first but settles down after a few minutes. Romeo would benefit and thrive in a home with a good, strong leader.""                "

We Are The Gonska Gang!Molly Gonska was born about December 1, 2008 and weighs about 50 lbs. She is a pretty girl with thick, medium length, fur just perfect for running your fingers through!  She is very human attentive and is find with the other dogs but we feel she will prefer to live as an only dog. She was raised with children and was fine. There is a little paperwork on Molly. It seems she was turned into the high kill pound because she was a ""runner"" and the home was not fenced. It also says she's not been leash trained...OK, so that meant the door was opened for her to potty (she did live inside) and then she was expected to stay in the small yard and come back to the door when she was finished - we get so confused. She actually does fine on leash. She's a sweet girl that will cherish you and you can see in her eyes that she is devastated to have been abandoned by those she thought she loved. This transport was sponsored by wonderful adopters, foster home, and long time volunteers the Gonska Family! We are so very thankful to them for all that they've done over the years to help with so many pets and they attend most every event graciously.  In their quest to help ALL animals they have chosen not to eat them. Molly did well on our cat test. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $175.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

He will spend his life on pain medication and supplements to help strengthen his hips. He functions like any normal one year old puppy, but he occasionally tips over. He loves to snuggle, can be a bed hog and lives for a belly rub. He is handsome beyond words! Kenny is not a fan of cats.

A volunteer writes: Lucy is all butt wiggling and tail wagging in her kennel. She is happy to see a person. It means a walk and company. She is beautiful, well nourished, wears a perfect and shiny dress and looks mighty healthy. At 4, Lucy might have had already a litter or two… She is so easy to handle, calm, sociable and walks so nicely in sync with her caretaker. She is not voracious for treats and even sits for them. She loves to be caressed and comes to the chest for kisses and hugs. Not everybody agrees with that, of course, as Ms Lucy is quite big. She is such an affectionate Rottie. She shows some interest in a tennis ball, runs after it, catches it in her mouth but then lets go… In the street, Lucy pulls a little toward other dogs and barks at some when she is in a pen. I have not seen her yet in playgroups with other pooches. Lucy is still young at 4 years of age, really good looking and friendly. She will make a sweet companion to the new owner who will give her the chance to be a forever best friend. Lucy is waiting for a Rottie lover at the Manhattan Care Center.

Thank you Goodman Family! Joyful Rescues "" Goodman Transport"" has saved 16 lives! That number will soon grow as two of the dogs came in VERY pregnant. From the Goodman family - In these past two years my family has adopted two very sweet and spunky pups from Joyful Rescues. Radicchio (now Maddie) and Stormy (now Micayla) both have brought so much joy to our family. It was Maddie who came to us scared and shy, she was just hours away from being euthanized. It took her a couple months to forget about her past in Kentucky, however she is now a completely different dog.Upon realizing how happy the dogs have made our lives, we decided that we needed to find a way to give back! Our family came up with the idea to put together a bottle/can and pet supplies drive. We had delivered over 1,500 flyers around our community, and drive around once a month to pick up donations. We would like to thank everybody that has contributed to our efforts. After seven months we had saved up enough to sponsor a rescue. Over the summer we made the decision to continue the drive and created a phase II to help save even more dogs. It is really important to us that we give other dogs a second chance at life, just as Maddie and Micayla had received. ~ The Goodman Family Leigh Ann Goodman is the Mom to Jack. Jack was born October 23, 2015 and we feel they will be as big or bigger than Leigh Ann who weighs about 55 lbs. So, please plan on a pup weighting in the 55 - 75 lb. range (or more) when full grown. They are silly, happy, playful pups and their Mom still acts like a big puppy herself. Jack Eichel is Rookie player number 15 of the Buffalo Sabres!

Joey was found tied up to a bench at a beach in Far Rockaway on a cold February morning by NYPD. Joey was the picture of the shameful result of neglect and abuse. He was malnourished at 48 pounds and suffering from a horrific case of demodectic mange that had advanced to the point where it ruptured his hair follicles, the year-and-a-half old Pit mix also suffered from a bacterial skin infection secondary to the mange that involved three different types of bacteria. Joey has recovered from his ailments and is ready for his forever home. Joey is young and very energetic. He would do best in a home with bully breed experience. He has been socialized with the rest of the pack in foster care but can be pushy at times. Joey likes being the center of attention.

Meet Tony Romo, a handsome 7 year old red and white Cocker Spaniel used to living as part of a pack. Tony was seized during the course of an eviction, together with his 5 Chihuahua housemates, all of whom ended up at Animal Care and Control. Sadly, the Chihuahuas were retrieved by their owner, but Tony was left behind. Tony is a very loving, friendly, beautiful boy who should make an excellent family pet with adults only. Since Tony has been with our rescue, he has been successfully treated for glaucoma. He is now partially blind and therefore requires a very special home with very few stairs to climb and a patient owner who can work with him. He is an otherwise healthy dog who has been neutered, microchipped, is current on all shots and has tested negative for heartworm. Tony will be treated to a dental cleaning as well as a professional grooming prior to his placement and will be sporting a new leash and collar at the time of going home. If you would like to adopt Tony, please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit http://www.nyabandonedangels.com/, where you can complete and return an on-line application.

She is very affectionate... loves to be held and cuddled, but can also be a feisty little girl.  Chia would do best in a home with no children and no other pets as she can be a bit food aggressive. Chia's adoption fee will be waived for an adopter willing to open their home to her. In lieu of an adoption fee, her adopter can make a donation to Rescued Treasures at their discretion. For more information and adoption applications (which must be completed to arrange a meeting) visit Rescued Treasures website at http://rescued-treasures.com/dog-application/. Due to a problem with some applications submitted not being forwarded to us, email Rescued Treasures at rescuedtreasuresadoptions@gmail.com once application has been submitted to notify us that application for (animal you applied for) has been submitted so we can contact you even if application does not go through. We are working on this problem.Before applying for this dog, please think the decision over thoroughly and make sure the whole family is in agreement. Owning a dog is a huge responsibility that is not something that should be rushed into. Each dog from Rescued Treasures has been saved from an uncertain future. If you are thinking about adopting, please remember it is a LIFE-LONG commitment. Dogs can live to be at least 14 years old...are you ready to take care of him/her that long?                
03/07/2016	Rocky - American Pit Bull Terrier / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Labrador Retriever Mix	Perry, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Name: Rocky   DOB: 08/17/2011   My name is Rocky...well because I am a fighter! I had an old leg injury that looks painful, but it isn't and it doesn't really slow me down much. I was rescued from the local animal control with no history on me or what happened...I just want to say I am over it and want to move forward and enjoy my life with a family who wont judge me based on my appearance. I am a very sweet dog who is currently being fostered with small children and dogs of all sizes, cats, and even small reptiles. Rocky has been examined by multiple veterinarians who concur that surgery is not necessary and that his leg causes him no pain.   Activities I enjoy are running and playing with toys and my family.   People would describe me as: Curious, Playful, Social butterfly, Active, Lap Loving.    My adoption fee is $100 which covers all of my medical care including neuter, microchip, rabies, vaccinations, and de-wormers.   Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

Please contact Dog (dogapplications@yahoo.com) for more information about this pet.DOB: August 2014 Hi! My name is Trubby and I am a Pit Bull mix! I just turned a year old. I love to play with foster moms other dogs, play fetch, go for walks, and play in water (mud is even better!) I am good at entertaining myself by throwing toys up in the air and chasing them. I also love to cuddle with my people, give kisses, take baths, and get my nails done! New places, people and new dogs are scary to me! I am being conditioned to not feel threatened by these things. I did not have a lot of guidance or exposure to new people and things in my previous environment. I am really a happy go lucky guy once I get to know you and your pets! I really get upset with screaming, crying and kids running around. I prefer older children who are a bit more calm. I am food motivated, HIGHLY intelligent, and aim to please, so teaching me new things is easy! I am very good about coming when called, even if I am a distance away. I need a 6' fenced in yard cause when I am excited I can jump high! I will give you lots of love and enjoyment if you are willing to spend some time to get to know me! I am house and crate trained and can be left out loose in the house during the night. I am beginning to have short periods of daytime out of the crate left alone. So far I have been pretty good about being respectful of the home!

I eat my meals politely and slowly, I walk nicely on my leash, I am curious when we encounter other animals, but I don't pull towards them and I can be easily turned away. I love to put my head on her lap for a little TLC and prefer to snuggle in bed, touching her over the dog bed or couch.    I play with my foster sister, who is a 3 year old, pittie-lab mix, she is the queen of the house. If I do something that she doesn't like,she corrects me, and we continue to play. we roll around in the grass, and chase and jump on each other until we are just dog tired!   I also live with a senior (14+) lab, I am very respectful, and I know that he doesn't want to play with me, so I don't ask. I have a crate and will go into it if you need me to, but I much prefer being curled up on the couch with my family. I know how to open a lever door handle, for some reason my foster mom doesn't like when I do that.   I love riding in the car, and feeling the wind across my nose. I am neutered, healthy, loving and have a strong desire to please my people. Please come and give me my furever home, I promise to love you with all my heart and be a good boy.

03/07/2016	Rihanna - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Our sweet Rhianna was saved from a horrible life of dog fighting. She was used as a bait dog to help build the confidence of the dogs bred to be champions. They filed her teeth down and used her and when they were done they dumped her on the street and she was taken to the dreaded NYC ACC where she landed on the kill list. Luckily  Second Chance Rescue NYC Dogs  saved her but with no foster or adopter Rhianna sat in boardi ng for over 2 years. She came to us back in October for training. When her training was done she still had nowhere to go so instead of seeing this sweet girl get sent back to boarding Ali has been fostering her for the last few months. Due to her past Rhianna has to be an only dog and Ali has her own animals and needs to keep Rhianna separate so she needs a permanent home where she can be the Queen of the Castle. Rhianna is learning how to live in a home and be a normal dog. She is great with people and loves everyone she meets. Due to her high prey drive we recommend a home with children over the age of 9 and no cats. In honor of all dogs forced to fight so humans can make money please share Rhianna and help us find her the forever home she has been waiting so long for. Rhianna's new owners will receive free handling lessons and support from us. To apply to foster or adopt her please fill out an application at http://www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/

03/07/2016	Cayenne - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	New York, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Saved from the NYC high kill shelter....    A volunteer writes: Big and handsome, Cayenne was relaxing in his kennel, but stood right up as I approached. A soft tan coat, a wagging tail and a smiling face all add up to a sweetheart of a dog who aced his behavior assessment indicating he’ll be a good fit in just about any home. A walk to the park gives him a chance to show off his housetraining skills, and although he pulls on the leash a bit is responsive to correction. Off leash in the back it was too hot to play ball so Cayenne explored the pen, as play group staff came over to say, “Isn’t he great?”. In group play he’s soft and easy, they call it ‘gentle and dainty play’, and he responds well to correction. Cayenne is camera shy so you’ll have to take my word for how handsome this big boy is. Cayenne is a hot spice, but there is nothing hot about this dog other than just how good he is. Mellow and easy, Cayenne is looking for his happily ever after to start today. .                
03/07/2016	Mugsy - Boxer / American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Bullboxer Pit	Lockport, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Boxer / American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat).

I was living in an Amish puppy mill. Amish breed & sell puppies to pet stores. I was born with inverted eye lashes and I was no longer a puppy any pet stores wanted, I was destined to be shot if Better Days had not come along to rescue me from this fate. I was born with a condition called Entropion which is when your eye lashes fold inward and rub against your eyes. It is extremely pain full and causes irritation and eye damage. It is fixable with expensive yet much needed surgery!! Better Days has fixed the issue and I am no longer in pain. My eyes feel and look wonderful. I am all set and ready for a forever home.  I am very shy and timid. I slowly will come up to you, but then I get afraid. But I am egar to please and coming around. I need some one to show me how to trust. Remember I only lived in a cage so I need to learn how to accept love and kindness. I do wag my tail when some one tries after I know them a bit. I get excided to see you. Guess what ! I have learned to go up stairs. My foster mom is teaching me new things, like walking on a leash and potty manners. I never had a warm bed or full tummy or belly rubs. I am still young like a puppy because no one taught me how to do things a dog should know.  I am learning new thing all the time but I will need some help and some one kind and patient to work with me . If you want to teach me new things and play with me I would be so grateful & show you by happy wags of my tail and puppy kisses. I won't be around here long because I am such a shy but friendly girl so please put your application in soon. Please go to www.betterdaysarecominginc.org to put your application in .                
03/07/2016	Daymond - Shepherd / Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	New York, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Shepherd / Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Please contact Jeannie (toomanyshepherds@aol.com) for more information about this pet.Psst, over here…. It’s me, Daymond. You like what you see, right? I’m about 6 years old and they say I’m a Shepherd/Pit mix but I'm sure there's some other good stuff mixed in there! I was found wandering the streets – plenty of us end up like that, and yes, I did have a collar embedded in my neck so deep the people at the shelter had to surgically remove it. But you know what? They couldn’t believe what a good boy I was. Sure, it hurt a lot, but I was all kissy and friendly. That’s all my rear-view, mirror, as they say.   Ok. Here’s what I want. I love going on walks. I used to be a little freaked by people I didn't know – especially men, because something bad must have happened to me when I was really young – but whew, I’ve really worked hard to move beyond that. That’s the kind of guy I am.   I know how to sit, am good on the leash, don’t pull at all and would probably make a good jogging partner. I’m neutered, current on my shots, and have got some serious muscles, even though I’ve been cooped up in a kennel for a while. I LOVE the water and the baby pool at the kennel, and my 'aunties' always make sure I get plenty of pool time.   Ever been told to eliminate the negative people in your life? I’ve done that. I could teach you a thing or two. Come check me out. It just might be a beautiful thing. Wanna know more about me?

This precious 6 year old 60ish lb brindle shepherd pit mix has a world of love to give! Ariel absolutely LOVES humans and children. With a heart of gold, Ariel will even let you play with her and her food dish while she is eating and loves to dress up in any costume or outfit! What a gem! Who could ever resist those soulful eyes, perky smile, and expressive ears? She looks forward to the day she can play, snuggle, and spoil her human! At this time, Ariel lives in a boarding facility. This is no life for any dog. Unfortunately, and by no fault of her own, the right family has yet to come along for her. Before she was dumped in a high kill shelter, the only life she knew was as a breeding machine and mommy. Once her ‘family’ no longer had any use for her, they dumped her in a rural TN shelter. Not only was she abandoned and on death row, but she was stuck in a location where it is ILLEGAL to adopt our a dog with any pit in them. Inevitably, Ariel was scheduled for death. Needless to say, Ariel did not die that day. She began a new life as a Twenty Paws dog. At a convenient 60 lbs, this doll yearns to finally know what its like to be someone's baby. She cared for so many in the past, and they were all stolen from her. No one cared for her at all.  She lavished at her newly found freedom and second chance. Eternally grateful to the vet staff for their determination to improve her health, Ariel showers them with kisses and wiggles. Truly, now it is her turn to experience love and affection.  Every night, Ariel dreams that someone will be her hero. Every night, she dreams that she can become part of a family. Could it be your family? Ariel deserves more than a life behind bars and a cold metal bed. Please consider fostering or adopting this survivor.  If interested in fostering or adopting, please email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com. **Due to a gmail glitch, we lose some emails. So if you do not hear back from us please follow up! We respond to all emails!**

Meet JOSIE, a sweet and petite, 5-year-old, sable Cocker Spaniel. She’s a little chunky at 19 pounds because her true weight should be only 15. Josie is one of our more sensitive angels.

I'm ROXY I'm a beautiful 4 yr F Brindle/White Amstaff/Boxer X. I am approx 55 lbs of PURE BROWN SUGAR. I was rescued in the nick of time from a high kill shelter in NY as a puppy & I found a home pretty quickly but due to a moving situation, my adopters couldn't keep me. I'm missing toes on my left front paw - not sure if I was born with this handicap or it was due to an accident or abuse - but as a result, I tend to walk with a little limp. It makes me a little insecure, but it doesn't hinder my amazing fetching abilities. I love to run and chase the ball and can play fetch all day! I am good with most dogs as long as they are calm, balanced i.e submissive and ones that don't care about toys since I like to hoard/protect them. I like to chase cats a bit too much and small kids have too much energy for me and make me nervous. I'm a bit guarded with strangers at first but as soon as I warm up to them, I'm their BFF forever esp if they have a ball! I'm looking for a quiet adult only home with someone who is medium active and knows my breed and will give me the support and confidence I need and play fetch with me everyday! A big fenced in yard would be great too! Please come meet/adopt me today!                
03/07/2016	Susie Q - Hound / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	New York, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed. SusiQ is patiently waiting for her yeasty-skin to completely go away, taking her baths, and her fur is growing back like crazy. She has been to the beach in Maine and ran from the waves, but otherwise kept her nose high up in the air for the best smells!! coming her way. She is most certainly a hound-mix, she loves her walks and scenting her way thru the woods. She rarely barks, but when she hears  the coyotes in the distance at night, will occasionally join in The Big Aroo. I am working on socializing her out in the world, and took her to a local dog supply store. A big dog barked at her from across the room, and she looked at me as if to say, what do I do? I laughed, and she barked right back at him in her hoarse, tentative hound bark, and had everybody laughing. She is a humorous girl, a little bit in her own world, and happy to join in on any adventure or car trip you may be heading out for. SusiQ came into Rescue having great difficulty with Trust. But as she has grown to trust me, she is more bold approaching people in public, and trusting that they will treat her as I do. She needs her eye-surgery done soon, and will be ready for her new home.

03/07/2016	Missy - American Bulldog / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Bulldog-Unknown Mix	Brooklyn, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: American Bulldog / Mixed. ***ADOPTER OR FOSTER NEEDED ASAP***  About a year ago Missy was found running loose in the subzero New England temperatures, malnourished and underweight. After 2 weeks of searching for her former family, no one claimed her. She was left abandoned- just a lonely scared puppy.    At 2 years old and 60 lbs, Missy, an STUNNING white American Bulldog, always was and continues to be sweet and loving to whoever came to care for her, full of kisses and a yodeling bark. Missy is very affectionate- providing endless kisses and snuggles in bed. She loves to lay on your lap too!   Missy has a lot of energy and loves to run; she eats well and will even sit on the chair at the table with you like a human. She is a very family oriented dog and loves to be around people. Due to her past abandonment, Missy prefers to be around humans, attention, and love. When you are not home, Missy patiently waits for you in her crate. Oh, and Missy LOVES baths, walks, and to chew on her toys. She has a toy box full of toys to keep her occupied; but, plastic bottles are her toy of choice.    As far as we know, Missy has never been around small children. She does do well around kids 10 years and older. Around cats, she hasn’t hurt them. She just does not realize know her own strength, as most of these mush balls tend to do. Missy should be the only dog in the home, as she prefers to be the only beloved canine in the home.    Missy is a wonderful dog and will be a devoted guard dog protecting her owner. She is a very happy dog and yodels instead of barking when greeting you- truly a unique and special young girl.

Banks is an exuberant, playful, loving ball of fun, just over 2 1/2 years old. He follows commands well and is working achieving on his Canine Good Citizenship.

Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.Han is a gigantic, beautiful, goofball. He was being kept as a breeding machine by a family that didn't treat him properly or socialize him with strangers. He is fearful of new people and is currently going through a training program to help make him more manageable for adoption. He is a very large dog, and because he does demonstrate fear aggressive behavior, we are requiring he goes to an adult only home that has experience with training and the Saint Bernard breed. We would love for him to be adopted alongside his friend Leia that he adores, but if the perfect home comes along for him that would only take one, we are willing to separate. Once he bonds with someone he trusts them completely and shows his dopey and lovable personality. He is a wonderful dog and deserves the chance to know a truly loving home that will treat him properly.

Hi my name is MYLO and I'm a 5/6 yr M White/Tan Chihuahua/Rat Terrier X. I'm 14 lbs of PURE SUGAR & SPICE!. I was surrendered by my family due to the death of my immediate owner and no room for me. Unfortunately I was not socialized properly with people and other dogs so when I lost my human pack leader, my whole world came crashing down. I was very terrified at the shelter and would get a little snarky/snippy with the shelter staff when they tried to touch me. But I warmed up with the volunteers that were patient and gave me a ""slow hand"". Once I get to know you and you give me space and not try to man handle me too much I will show you a whole lotta love and snuggle right next to you!. Because of my shy fearfulness, it's best that I go to an ""Adult Only"" home and with someone who has had previous experience with my breed. I'm a super loving little boy but am just too insecure and afraid that I can get a little snappy. I am very housebroken, crate trained and walk well on a leash. I'm not fond of cats but I am ok with small quiet calm dogs. Pls give me a chance and come meet/adopt me today!

Logan is a typical energetic puppy who gets along great with his foster brothers and sisters, but he is definitely a people pleaser. He just wants to love and snuggle with his human foster family. We do not recommend small energetic children, and we are unsure of cats at this time. He is food motivated, which makes training FUN! He's also crate training and potty trained. He's just a big goofball, who's looking for a nice comfy home to call his own. If he is what you've been looking for, fill out an adoption application today!!                
03/07/2016	Troy - American Staffordshire Terrier / Shepherd / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Shepherd / Mixed (short coat). Troy is a happy boy with a lot of potential. He loves to be around people and and a lot of the times will press up against you for love. He is a medium to high energy dog and would do great on hikes, jogs and long walks, so an active home would be ideal. He does great in the crate and is house broken. He is extremely compliant and willing to please but it is highly recommended that his new family follows through with his training. He knows his sits, downs, stay climb, come and walks nicely on a leash. He has gotten better with other dogs but I wouldn't recommend him going to a home with one just to be safe. I haven't tested him with kids but the only issue I can predict with young kids is his energy levels and so I would suggest he goes to a home with no kids or a family with kids 10 and older. He has never shown signs of possession or reactivity to his people and with continuous training he will make someone's family and life complete with his happy loving personality                
03/07/2016	FOSTERS NEEDED - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Flushing, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel. Abandoned Angels has recently been inundated with many homeless Cocker Spaniels from various shelters, with more expected to arrive soon. All of these dogs were in imminent danger of being euthanized. WE ARE IN URGENT NEED OF FOSTER HOMES to house some of these dogs until permanent homes can be found for them. All of these precious babies will be up to date on vaccinations, dewormed, spayed/neutered and examined by our Vet, in addition to being groomed, prior to being placed in foster care. Abandoned Angels is committed to caring for the homeless Cocker Spaniels it rescues until they are well.  By fostering a dog, you will help us to learn about the dog prior to its adoption and enable us to find the right home. You will also be invaluable in giving the dog an opportunity to trust and love again. Most of the Angels we rescue were either abandoned, neglected and/or abused through no fault of their own. We strive to restore their spirits, as well as their physical health, both of which have often been broken by human beings.  Please contact us if you wish to become a foster family for one or more of our Angels. Due to a deficit of foster homes, some of our Angels must be boarded, which is not only costly to us, but also not the best situation for our Angels to heal emotionally. Even though our Angels are loved and cared for while boarding, there is no place like a home for them to truly feel safe and secure.  Interested fosters will be asked to complete our foster application and a home visit by one of our representatives will be necessary. By fostering an Angel, you will not only help that particular dog, but you will allow us to rescue more dogs in need.  In about 6 years, Abandoned Angels has rescued over 6750+ dogs, mostly Cocker Spaniels, although we will also take in other breeds when space allows. Please join our Abandoned Angels family and help us to continue saving these precious lives. Please help our Angels in waiting by opening your heart and home for just a week, a month, or perhaps longer, until they are able to find their true forever homes. Rescued dogs are very grateful for the love, food and shelter they receive and know when they have been saved and given a second chance.  If you are not ready to adopt, please consider fostering or sponsoring one of our many Angels, who can be viewed at www.petfinder.com or on our website www.nyabandonedangels.com. All of our Angels thank you for your help. We look forward to hearing from you!

Being from Texas, she loves to cuddle up under a blanket on these cold winter days. And if given the opportunity to snuggle up on a lap for some extra belly rubs, she just might stay there forever! Not only is she great at cuddling, but she enjoys a little action too! She loves to play with toys and run around with you too!She is wonderful even with the smallest of children and is eager to give them kisses (she is fostered with 3 young children). She is also good with other dogs, but chases cats. She has been trained to sleep in her crate and will stay in there while no one is home, but I am sure she would be more than happy to cuddle up in a bed at night, close to her family. She is still working on house breaking, it was going much better until this bitter cold hit! She is also working on basic commands and leash walking. But she learns quickly and is eager to please! We hope that she finds a forever home with lots of people to shower her with the love she deserves!Eleanor is spayed, heartworm negative, microchipped, and has her rabies, distemper/parvo, and bordatella vaccinations.

03/07/2016	Pecan Pie Penny - Cocker Spaniel / Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel-Unknown Mix	Flushing, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel / Terrier / Mixed. This lil’ 8 year old doll named Penny is as sweet as pecan pie so we’ve named her Pecan Pie Penny! “PPP” (or “triple P” for short) is a petite Cocker Spaniel mix who was picked up as a stray roaming the streets of New York City. This pawsitively lovable gal weighs in at just 25 pounds which makes her even more precious! Penny’s legs are a tad short and which makes us believe that she may have some terrier in her. One thing is for sure, poor Pecan Pie Penny is completely blind with cataracts and glaucoma. We hope to bring her to an ophthalmologist within a week for a full exam. In the meantime, PPP gets around remarkably well by relying on her sense of smell, touch, and hearing. Penny is currently in a foster home where her foster mama says, “Penny lives in the moment and is happy and will be a real treasure for somebody. She just has so much love to give.”  We think so too which is why we’re shouting from the rooftops, “Pick Pecan Pie Penny, please!”  PPP has been spayed, microchipped, is up to date on all shots, and has tested negative for heartworm. She will be treated to a professional grooming and will go home with a new leash and collar. If you would like to pick Pecan Pie Penny to be your own, please fill out an application online at  www.nyabandonedangels.com  or email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com  to request one.

Up for adoption/foster is our handsome boy DUDE aka Dimitri. This ""Dude"" is all charm and will warm your heart! He loves giving kisses! He'll turn upside down in a second for a good belly rub ! Dude is more of a mellow kind of dog. He is a friendly boy and is welcoming to people he meets. He has so much good inside of him he sometimes just doesn't know the right way to convey it. Almost being a little ""goofy"" and forward when trying to explain his emotions! But Dude has such a good soul, and is such a good boy all around! We think Dude will be okay with older children around the age of 12 and up who will be responsible. He can be a little jumpy so a smaller child would not be recommended. Dude would be best in a home as an only pet . Sharing a doggie bed is not something he wants to do. He is not a fan of cats so a cat free home would be necessary as well. Dude enjoys getting some outdoor exercise, loves his toys and loves a good treat! Dude knows basic Command such as SIT and is willing to learn so much more. Dude would really benefit from an experienced owner who will continue to work with him. There truly is no end in site on how far this boy can go! He is crate trained, house trained and walks great on leash. He is UTD on shots and is neutered. He is going to make an awesome addition to the right family. If you would like to meet Dude Please fill out an application with us  http://nycsecondchancerescue.org/app-form/                "

Nilla came into the shelter as a stray so her past is unknown. An average rated beauty, she quickly caught the attention of a foster who wanted to save her life. Unfortunately for Nilla this person would just be another who would disappoint her. Rejected by her foster for being “too strong” and wanting to chase cats Nilla was moved to boarding after only being in their house for 10 minutes.   Based on her evaluation at the shelter we believe that Nilla would do well with an average family who has the ability/strength to handle a large dog. No small dogs or cats please and children middle school age or older just due to her size.

Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.Panda is a stunning, bubbly, and loving example of the pitbull breed! She is very playful and enjoys running in the snow and taking long walks with her people! She is too smart and energetic for a kennel environment and she deserves a family that has the time and love to give her the life she deserves. Panda’s history is unknown, since she was found in a crate in an abandoned house in Philadelphia. After being bounced around once the shelter housing her closed down, she came to stay with us at Adopt-A-Dog. While most dogs first arriving at our shelter are nervous or scared, Panda was the opposite. She immediately befriended every new person she met, and even rolled over for belly rubs! In the past few months we have had her with us, she has learned many things, like how to play with toys, walk well on leash, and perform basic obedience commands. She does play well with some other dogs, but because she can be selective about her play mates, we are looking to place her as an only pet. She would do well in a home with older children or teenagers and up, in a family that is searching for a dog to love, play with, and enjoy with a smile! For more information on Panda, please call (914)-273-1674 or go online to www.adopt-a-dog.org If you would like to fill out our adoption application, please go to https://goo.gl/oUcqxk

Blue Ivy is good with strangers, likes kids, and is house broken and crate trained. The perfect family for Blue Ivy is one that loves kisses and snuggles, is active, and has the time to continue his training. He doesn't want to share the love so he needs to be the only pet and children middle school age or older just due to his size.

That doesn't really matter to us at this point, she is just cute as a button and ready to find her forever home! Taya is a big bundle of joy! She is such a wiggly butt and constantly on the move. She is learning how to walk on a leash and take treats from your hand. She doesn't have the patience to find smaller training size treats but will take slightly larger bites gently. She is still learning how to live inside a house, but has mastered stairs and the sliding glass door. She does get nervous sometimes but is coming out of her shell every day. She will go in her crate for meals and times when she can't be supervised. She loves to play in the back yard with me or the other dogs. She also loves the obstacles set up in my backyard and could be a great dog to take up a new sport with like agility, freestyle or flyball!  Her adoption fee is $300 and that includes her neuter, microchip, vaccines, dewormer, etc. In order to be considered for adoption you must first fill out an application on our website at www.goingtothedogsrescue.org (click Adopt then Application)Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

I Weigh a WHOLE Five Pounds!Kam was born March 22, 2005 and weighs 5 lbs. She is as cute as can be, but is a bit on the nippy side.

03/07/2016	Wilma - Chihuahua (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chihuahua	Lockport, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Chihuahua (short coat). Meet Wilma. She spent 5 years in a puppy mill, never leaving the cage.  She is still learning to trust and that belly rubs will be a daily routine in her new life!! She is only 5 years old. She, surprisingly, is already house broken. I think she took a lesson from the other fur babies in the house. She has never gone in her crate and already knows what to do in the yard!! She is still very afraid of touch and as much as I believe she loves it, she freezes up and isn’t sure what to make of it. She will need a lot of love and patience. I try to hold and pet her daily, so she knows what belly rubs are and how great they can be! Wilma’s crate is her safe haven, although the door is always open she has been more comfortable sitting in there. Daily she comes out for her treats, food and to run around the kitchen a bit. She is slowly learning how fun it is to run around a counter or to chase her fur sisters and brothers. In time, I think she will love to be out of the crate on someone’s lap!   She is great around the other dogs in our home and her temperament is very timid.  The adoption fee for Wilma is $250.00. She will come to you fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped.  If you are interested in Wilma please consider filling out an application!! **ADOPT - DON'T SHOP**Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, Microchipping and deworming and flea treatment.                
03/07/2016	Ellie - Beagle / Miniature Pinscher / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Meagle	Cuba, NY	Female	Adult	"Posted Breed: Beagle / Miniature Pinscher / Mixed (short coat). Oh, my, that was a long trip!Ellie was born about November 25, 2009 and weighs about 17 lbs. She is an adorable, delicate looking, little tri-colored girl that is just wonderful with the other dogs here. She travels well in a car and good thing since her human brought her here from CT !  The phone rings and there is a woman rather upset because she can't keep her dog and she's very angry with all the shelters she's called because ""they were turning their backs on her dog"".  I take a deep breath, as she is still talking, and ask where she was calling from and she said CT. I ask if she knew how far away she was calling and she said she'd take her anywhere. I listened for awhile longer and then said ""fine, you can bring her here"". Of course not thinking she really would! Several days later she called to say she'd be here the next day and I was still surprised when she showed up! OK, so back to the Ellie: She's good in the car (good thing!) and she is good in the house. She is a quiet little girl, just hangs out on the top of the couch most of the day and in our laps in the evening. She does take some warm up time and a home where there are just one or two humans and not a ton of company would be best, she's just reserved with those she doesn't know and can be nippy if cornered or frightened. So, all in all, she isn't a perfect dog, but she will be well loved again in the right home. Ellie was hit by a car when she was a year old and we have a copy of her records which couldn't be read due to the handwriting, but the vet office was nice enough to have the vet translate that the trauma Ellie experienced was an avulsion fracture of the femoral head and a right luxated hip. They popped the hip back in and due to her young age the fracture was able to heal on it's own. A few weeks later there were no signs of any discomfort and there will be no issues long term. She was lucky! Ellie is panicky in a crate and does need her owners home much of the time. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $250.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

03/07/2016	Nala - courtesy post - American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Rochester, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). To adopt, the very first step is to fill out an application found on our website, where you can also read about our adoption process: www.wooftowndoggydaycare.com/adopt_a_dog.   OUR ADOPTION FEE IS $250 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED*This is a courtesy post fo a dog in need in the community. Nala is not a Wooftown Foster*   Nala is a 2.5 year old pitbull mix. She is quite the cuddler and lap dog when she wants to be. She loves to be outdoors and either playing in the grass or lounging on the patio. She is good with bigger male dogs. She is excellent with kids and does get excited to see new people. She is spayed and current on all vaccinations. She will need to go to a home with no small dogs or cats. She would prefer to be an only dog or a home with a male dog, does become slightly dominant with female dogs. She is housebroken and crate trained. She has a loving personality and is quite the funny girl. Please give her a chance you will not regret it!!!    We provide as much information on each animal's history, disposition and health as we can gather. Most of our dogs are from shelters and are strays, therfore we may not have any information at all on them, or what breed they are.  We strongly believe that honesty is the best policy. We want each of our animals to find the RIGHT home, not just ANY home. Likewise, we want you to find the pet who best matches your lifestyle and interests. You will first be required to complete our adoption application. Once received, a WT rep will contact you via phone or e-mail. If it seems you are a good fit for each other based on the info you provided, a phone interview will follow. If you are renting, we require proof that you are allowed to have a pet as well as any breed or size restrictions that may exist. If you have pets or did previously, we require your vet information and we will call them to verify that your pets are in good health, current on vaccines and spayed/neutered. We require that all pets in the home be spayed/neutered unless there are health reasons that can be verified with the vet. The final step is a home visit, where an WT volunteer comes to your home to verify your home is a safe place for an animal. It is also a time where the volunteer can answer questions and discuss safety precautions. In our Adoption Agreement, we require that every animal be spayed/neutered prior to adoption this means every dog that is adopted from us will be spayed/neutered prior to going to a forever home. This is VERY important as the overpopulation of dogs and cats in our country is a sad result of too many unplanned litters!  If for any reason the match is not as perfect as we all had hoped, the dog or cat must be returned to Wooftown, not given away or turned in to a shelter. Serious fines apply to violators of the Wooftown Agreement to Adopt. So be clear about what you are signing and be prepared to abide by the contract. It is legally binding and we take it very seriously.

She is an American Pit mix who loves to play fetch, loves to snuggle, is friendly and great on walks. She was rescued by some nice folks in Connecticut who are looking for the family that will love her forever. They will be rewarded with a great dog in return.

She's 4 years old, spayed, up to date on her shots, and healthy.

To adopt, the very first step is to fill out an application found on our website, where you can also read about our adoption process: www.wooftowndoggydaycare.com/adopt_a_dog.   OUR ADOPTION FEE IS $250 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTEDDutchie is a cute little 8 year old poodle looking for the right home. He does really well in quiet homes with quiet, patient people. He does have an aggressive streak with dominant people and kids when his signals are not heeded, but he growls to warn before biting. He has bitten on multiple occasions, including at the vet and groomer.  He is super smart, sweet, and loyal with those he decides he likes. This means that the right person has an opportunity to form an amazing bond and fulfilling companionship from this little guy.  He would do better in a home without other dogs just because he needs quiet and calm to relax and let his nice side shine through. He definitely cannot be around children. If you are interested in meeting Dutchie, please fill out our adoption application! He is free to the perfect home.    We provide as much information on each animal's history, disposition and health as we can gather. Most of our dogs are from shelters and are strays, therfore we may not have any information at all on them, or what breed they are.  We strongly believe that honesty is the best policy. We want each of our animals to find the RIGHT home, not just ANY home. Likewise, we want you to find the pet who best matches your lifestyle and interests. You will first be required to complete our adoption application. Once received, a WT rep will contact you via phone or e-mail. If it seems you are a good fit for each other based on the info you provided, a phone interview will follow. If you are renting, we require proof that you are allowed to have a pet as well as any breed or size restrictions that may exist. If you have pets or did previously, we require your vet information and we will call them to verify that your pets are in good health, current on vaccines and spayed/neutered. We require that all pets in the home be spayed/neutered unless there are health reasons that can be verified with the vet. The final step is a home visit, where an WT volunteer comes to your home to verify your home is a safe place for an animal. It is also a time where the volunteer can answer questions and discuss safety precautions. In our Adoption Agreement, we require that every animal be spayed/neutered prior to adoption this means every dog that is adopted from us will be spayed/neutered prior to going to a forever home. This is VERY important as the overpopulation of dogs and cats in our country is a sad result of too many unplanned litters!  If for any reason the match is not as perfect as we all had hoped, the dog or cat must be returned to Wooftown, not given away or turned in to a shelter. Serious fines apply to violators of the Wooftown Agreement to Adopt. So be clear about what you are signing and be prepared to abide by the contract. It is legally binding and we take it very seriously.

Saved on my last Week of Life!Cole was born about January 27, 2013 and will probably weigh in the 80 lb. range when full grown. He is from a very remote southern area shelter. We were told that any dogs who've been there the longest without interest by adopters or other rescues after that weekend would likely be euthanized the following Tuesday. The dog pound has a 150 dog capacity with 200 in the shelter at that time. Well, how could we leave this cutie chunk heads behind? So, Brad the volunteer pilot, and our great transport drivers had extra room so we could add him. Cole enjoys water and does wonderful with his other same size foster dog, but he is a little too rough for small children, small dogs and shouldn't live with a cat. She will need some warm up time as he is shy of humans until he is comfortable with them. He LOVES to play ball and is good about going in his crate. He is very food motivated so easy to train with treats. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $150.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations.

Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.Roxie is looking to explore all the wonderful things the world has to offer. She has proven to be a great agility, fetch, and running partner. Roxie definitely can keep up with active family looking for a four-legged companion.  Roxie was a puppy bought from a backyard breeder to a family that had never owned a dog before. They didn’t know much about caring for a dog. They did not exercise, play with, train, or even feed her properly, so when she arrived at Adopt-A-Dog she was skinny, full of pent up energy, and very jumpy. She didn’t even know how to play with toys! With consistent training Roxie has shown great improvement & is looking for a family that will continue her training. She has shown great improvement on leash manners as well. Roxie can still be a bit jumpy when excited so she is being shown better ways to introduce herself.  Roxie would do best in a home with older children, since she is still ocassionally jumpy and needs to be reminded to mind her manners. Roxie has potential to live with another dog if it is the right fit. If you think you would be the perfect family for her, please call us at (914)-273-1674 or go online to www.adopt-a-dog.org.

03/07/2016	Eclair Au Chocolat - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Flushing, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel. Meet ""Eclair Au Chocolat"" (fondly known as Chocolate), our rescue's resident Pastry Chef. Like most Cocker Spaniels , Chocolate is rather food obsessed, however he takes it up a notch (like any great chef, he is more like ""food addicted""). Although he will hoover up almost anything delectable, Chocolate does best on a grain free diet (recommended for all Cocker Spaniels), which is great for ears and skin. Chocolate is a very special boy (very dear to us) who is looking for an experienced Cocker Spaniel home. He is extremely loving and affectionate and a real glutton for attention (especially belly rubs), which he will reciprocate in kind with lots of Cocker Kisses. However he is also quite a sensitive dog who requires a gentle touch (any form of rough housing will almost certainly scare him). Chocolate is a bit of an older boy now (his age is estimated to be around 8) and has been waiting for placement for a while ... although he is a beautiful dog (chocolate merles are rather rare), many adopters have sadly passed him by in favor of a ""younger model."" As a fairly laid back boy, Chocolate will make a wonderful dog for a single person who is looking for a companion or perhaps a couple of empty nesters who are looking for a new Chocolate baby to love and spoil. If you are a walker, then Chocolate is just the dog for you, as he adores his outings to the park and is great on the leash. Chocolate is a healthy dog who has been neutered, microchipped, is current on all shots and has tested negative for heartworm. He will be treated to a dental cleaning as well as a professional grooming before going home, so will be starting out his new life fully loaded and on the right foot. If you would like to adopt or foster our little Eclair Au Chocolat, please email  rescue@nyabandonedangels.com  or visit  http://www.nyabandonedangels.com/ , where you can complete and return an application on-line. With a daily dose of Chocolate in your life, things are sure to be a whole lot sweeter.                "

With Cam IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU!!!!Cam was born about December 9, 2009 and weighs about 11 pounds. No, kidding, this guy is CUTE!!! He won our hearts over shortly after arriving. He is going to make someone very, very, happy. I can't imagine how he was given up because his humans were too busy, but if that was the case then he is better off here because we all love him. He has some anxiety when being left alone and he truly needs to have his humans around much of the time. Cam can be around other dogs just fine, but he cannot be on his humans lap around other dogs. He can be near his human on the floor, etc., but not on the lap.  His main purpose in life is snuggling and loves to be under blankets. Cam is good on leash and did great with toddlers around his last home. Cam is good about using a dog door to potty, but if you don't have one you may want to keep a potty floor pad around for times that he can't hold it. He would be perfect for a senior that wants a loving, interactive, fun, constant companion.  He loves going for walks and adores rides in the car - anything to be with you! He is a super smart little guy and will love you more than you can imagine.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $225.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.

Meet Luca who we rescued from BACC. He is a loving, goofy, gentle 10 month old lab/hound/Pit mix. Lucas is a total lover! He is very obedient, at only 10 months old. He knows basic commands like SIT and DOWN. He takes treats gently and enjoys belly rubs, ear rubs, and lots of affection from his human. He gives the best kisses too. He gets along with his fosters female dog even allowing her to be in charge if he over steps his boundaries with her. He enjoys people very much. He has been sociable and playful with teens he has met as well as a 9 year old. He does need to learn when greeting people that jumping is not allowed. You need to be mindful of his jumping so it is recommended children who are a bit older would be best for Luca only because he may knock a smaller child down. With correction, we believe in no time his jumping up will be a thing of the past. Luca is still young and has some puppy ways no doubt, in time, Luca will master all and be the perfect pet. He will make a family proud. He is eager to listen and willing to learn. He LOVES to swim, enjoys playtime like: fetch, ball playing and tug of war. He loves his chew toys and will entertain himself. He needs some work on his leash manners. When sharing his walks with his foster canine friend he does pulls to keep up the pace. He needs to be reminded to slow down and follow command. He walks better when being walked alone. He is house trained and does his business outside. Cats are unknown at this time but when going past them he does not react much. He is 75 pounds of pure affection. He is a strong boy and will do wonderful with a pack leader that he can look up to Luca is a big puppy who is becoming a fine young adult. His possibilities are endless. If you would like to adopt this handsome boy please fill out an application.

03/07/2016	Maverick - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Brooklyn, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Hello! My name is Maverick, but my mom and dad call me fatty! I will answer to either or. I am 50 lbs of love! Please don’t be turned off by my scars, everyone calls them beauty marks once they actually look at them, They don’t hurt me or bother me at all, actually I love when my mom smooshes my fat cheeks and pulls on them. Although I have had a real tough path medically, I am 100000% healthy!  When I was first adopted I was very cautious of my new family. I would not let my guard down and would never think of cuddling. BOY WAS I MISSING OUT! I love cuddling now! If you aren’t paying attention to me and I want to cuddle I will waddle on over and plop myself right on your chest! And don’t worry about making room for me, if you are laying down watching tv I will simply lay on your legs and rest my head right on your stomach. Because I love cuddling so much I NEED to sleep in bed with you at night. Mom says I am the perfect alarm clock! 7 am everyday I lick her until she wakes up! If that doesn’t work I jump off the bed and stomp around until she HAS to get up. And as much as I love cuddling I LOVE FOOD! If you say “Mav you hungry?” WATCH OUT! I will steam roll right thru you to run into my crate! (I have to eat in my crate because I eat too fast, and I don’t like to share my food) The vet told my mom to put a brick in my food to slow my eating down, some people try to put a ball but I just picked that up and moved it. I love food of all kind so be careful, if you are opening the fridge I will be right behind you (dad sometimes closes the door without looking first and my head is still in there)   Playtime is ALL the time! I will play with anything and everything! Cardboard, bouncy balls, ropes, ANYTHING! I am really silly and throw things up and the air (mom doesn’t know if its on purpose or if I am just so excited that it just happens) I am not very graceful when I run (Mom has literally peed her pants at the sight of me running, she says its like a weird gallop that all my feet leave the ground at once) I don’t always play the nicest, but I am learning! If you say “mouth” I tend to stop using my mouth to play. I love wrestling, mom and dad pick me up and slam me on their bed and wrestle with me, I love it! I also love learning! I know sit, down/off, lay down, look, leave it, stay, drop it (can I have it), and I am learning more! I am very food motivated, but sometimes I have an A.D.D moment just get my attention back and I am ready to go!  Hygiene is very important to me. So much so that I will jump in the shower with you when you are taking a shower! I also sit nice in the bath and love LOVE LOVE when I am having lathering shampoo all over me. I need to get my nails cut often because we are in the process of cutting the vein back. I am not such a big fan of this, but if you keep playing with my paws I will get better at it.   I hope you don’t need privacy because NOONE goes to the bathroom without me watching. I love to just awkwardly sit right in front of who ever is going potty and stare. If you try to go in without me I will just push the door open and let myself in. Also make sure you close the toilet seat cover when you are done, I have drank ALL the water out of the bowl before. And make sure the toilet paper is high up because I am known for taking the rolls and running off with them. (Mom has this on video)  Unfortunately, I don’t get along well with other dogs. I am too scared! My blood pressure goes up so fast that my whole head turns red, literally my scars and my ears. I have tried but I get too scared and start acting really bad. Because of this is why my mom and dad can’t keep me anymore. They love me and I know they do, but their lifestyle and what I need just don’t mix right now. They don’t have a yard and they live a very active life style (which is what we originally thought I needed). As I get older we realize that I need to stay in a comfort zone of never leaving MY HOUSE. I need a yard to run in and roll around in the grass (I love it so much) and I need a family who will let me be as silly as I love to be. Mom and dad have been told that they can try mood stabilizers but they love my personality and they don’t want to change that. People think that I am dangerous because I don’t play well with others, this couldn’t be MORE WRONG! I am a people LOVER mom and dad have had people over and I love every single one of them (Sometimes too much!) I lick them all over until they cant breath because they are covered in slober!  I really need a family who will keep working with me, because I love life so much! I have fought so hard to be able to live and I want to keep enjoying the life that so many people have fought for! Mom and Dad know I deserve that and know that I will be okay and happyish at their house, but they know I will have an even better life with someone who will never make me leave home.

We pulled her and she was placed with an adopter. She was returned for a ""claim"" by her past adopters that she had food aggression. Funny thing is, all that know her never have witnessed such behavior from her. She eats fast but shows no concerning behavior to any of the staff members at boarding. She does need an owner that will keep her on the right path. A person she can look up to and respect. She is socialized with different groups of dogs daily and is great with all. In her prior home she was not interested in their cat. Valentina is a super sweet goofy girl. She would greatly benefit with someone willing to train her on basic manors making her shine. She is smart and catches on fast. Valentina is truly a good girl, and deserves a chance. Please apply for her. http://nycsecondchancerescue.org/app-form/                "

03/07/2016	Leggo - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Leggo needs a home asap. Please consider to adopt or foster this handsome boy.  His adopter has developed severe allergies. All avenues were explored medically to try to make it work, but nothing has helped. So the decision to give Leggo up has been made. Leggo is uplifting, smart, sneaky and a fun pup. His adopter has truly enjoyed Leggo. He gets along well with Tux the cat at home, although Tux is a bit of a grump Leggo seems to brush it off and goes about his business.  As for kids, Leggo does well and has had no issues around his niece and nephew. They really love Leggo who has been great with them. Leggo stayed with them while his adopters were on a business trip, they heard great things about how well behaved Leggo was. They didn't even mind that Leggo's puppyish side made a little trouble with some hot wheels cars being confused with a chew bone. There were no hard feelings for this event. Laughs, actually. Other then that he was next to a perfect gentlemen. When on walks Leggo gets a little nervous or fearful when seeing strangers with out a proper introduction. At home he is fine with strangers that are welcomed by his family. He is very friendly and enjoys the company. There have been many times when he'll meet a dog and it's totally fine. They'll sniff each other, walk alongside each other without a problem. A few other times, he didn't like the other dogs energy and he'd let the dog know when the dog got too close. A meet and greet would be best if there are other dogs in the home. His leash skills have improved and leash training will need to be continued. Leggo is a great boy. He has good energy and enjoys walks, hikes and going to the beach. He is house trained, and crate trained. He has gone to training, for both one on one and group training which his adopter has paid for the life of Leggo. If Leggo's new family would like to continue this training his prior adopter will guide his new family on how to continue this training. If you would like to make Leggo part of your life please fill out an application for him. http://www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/

Jace's foster mom has declared him &quot;the world's best cuddler!&quot; Our handsome Jace is currently in a VT foster home waiting for a family to call his own. He is just about 1 1/2 yr old and is sweet as can be with people, but he's a little too bouncy for small children under the age of 10. He loves to play fetch (Kong Wubba is his favorite) and tug-o-war, and is very good about giving back toys. He's a big strong boy who is very vocal when he plays.  He walks well on leash and can get over-excited when he sees other dog, so a fenced back yard and/or country setting would be best. He is house-trained, crate trained, knows many commands, &quot;sit,&quot; &quot;stay,&quot; &quot;go to bed&quot; and &quot;give.&quot;  Jace loves to cuddle on the sofa with his favorite people. While he is friendly with friendly dogs outside of his home, he gets jealous in the home and should be an only pet. Because of his size and energy level, he needs an experienced owner who will give him structure and consistency.

JoJo is very anxious in the loud, busy kennel environment, has difficulty keeping weight on and is very stressed out. she breaks our hearts bcz she was doing great in a home and loved it: but she needs more space and a responsible dog savvy guardian with possibly a fenced yard or a home outside the city, so she has more quiet and space to be herself and be able to exercise in a no-pets environment. we're heartbroken to see her back at the kennel, and we're actively looking for a safe loving home and family who doesn't mind she has to be an only pet. she is a lovebug and very sweet, loves to play but mostly loves to cuddle and chill with her people. come meet her and consider adopting our sweet girl!

Further information, applications and available pets can be found at http://www.rescued-treasures.comMeet miss Allie! She is such a sweetheart! She is about four years old and came to us from a terrible breeding situation, and so the main issue that we are working her through right now is fear. She is extremely submissive and quiet, and it takes her a while to warm up to anyone new. But once she does, it becomes so clear that the only thing she wants or needs is lots of love. She is so content just to sit and be petted by her foster mom. She also LOVES to sleep in front of the space heater! She does great with cats but would do best as the only dog (she tends to get jealous because she wants all the love to herself--and she deserves it!). Since she was confined to a cage all her life, she is not yet fully potty trained, but she is quickly getting better with it.  She is the sweetest girl and just needs someone who will be able to go slowly and show her that all they want to do is love her. She would definitely do best in a quiet home. She just wants lots of love and attention, which she thoroughly deserves after all she has gone through! Any family would be lucky to have her. Consider applying to adopt Allie! Allie's Adoption fee is $250 after all vetting.

03/07/2016	Milo (NC) - Chinese Crested-Hairless (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Kingston, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Chinese Crested-Hairless (short coat). Adoption Application link: http://crest-care.net/forms.htm  Milo is a male hairless Chinese Crested being fostered in North Carolina. He’s quite the looker with his well-toned, muscular body and black and white furnishings. He weighs about 16 pounds. His birth date is 10/20/10.    Milo is current on all vaccines, heartworm negative and neutered.   Milo is the son of Macon who is also be up for adoption. Although Milo and Macon have been together for quite some time, it is not necessary that they be adopted together.    Before Milo came into rescue, he was living outside! He is now an indoor dog and loving it! He has adjusted quite nicely to the house and is totally crate trained. He has not had any accidents inside, but is usually supervised when loose in the house.   Milo is a super loving guy with a great disposition. He is the happiest, bounciest, most exuberant fellow who just can’t get enough of his person. He sticks to his person like glue and is always anxiously awaiting every bit of attention he can get. In fact, he sticks so close to his human when walking that you have to be careful not to step on him. He loves to cuddle with you as soon as you sit down and follows you when you get up.   He is very quiet except when strangers approach or when he acts as bandleader of the yodel fest held occasionally in the mornings. Don’t worry; he doesn’t get the other dogs yodeling until well after everyone, both humans and dogs, is awake!    I do not know how Milo behaves around children, but he would probably do well with older children. Once he would get used to children, he would most likely love all the attention, activity and playtime they could offer him.     Milo gets along very well with other dogs and displays submissive behavior in a pack situation. He enjoys being around and playing with other dogs, and would probably enjoy the company of another dog. He’s not too fond of getting baths, but is learning to tolerate them. He rides well in a car.   When Milo first arrived into foster care, he had a high prey drive and could not be trusted around cats or other small animals. I am very glad to say that he is overcoming his urge to go after the household cats quite nicely and the cats and he are learning to be in the same room at the same time without incidence. I would, however, still not trust him alone with a cat or small animal without strict supervision.   Milo has got so much love to give—it’s just exploding out of his little body—he just needs a family to give it all to. Could you be his family? You would be getting a wonderfully devoted little dog.

We all could not believe that after 11 years anyone could surrender their beloved pet to a high-kill shelter.. But that is exactly what happened to our Lil-Bit. ...  Lil-Bit is one of the sweetest spunkiest, happy-go-lucky senior gals that we have ever rescued. This little petite beauty, who is almost completely blind, won the hearts of everyone she met at the shelter. When she landed on the dreaded kill list, we couldn't ignore the call for help from staff and volunteers alike. So we pulled Lil-bit to safety she spent some time at the vet and underwent many diagnostic tests, she has anemia. She just went to her amazing foster home a week ago, and she is doing very well. She now enjoys lounging on the porch looking out at the pastures. Her foster mom is an angel, and has a big heart for the special seniors. Lil-Bit is still looking for her forever home, and has some time left to give her family unconditional love.

03/07/2016	Zak -Rescueadopt.com - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	NORWICH, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat). Please email if you would like an adoption application . 016 - Another year, cannot believe but I am growing old here. Not that I feel any older than one year. Slender and agile, life is a game! I still cannot be trusted off leash indoors, too many irresistable objects to investigate and often thoroughly examine. Little dogs still fascinate me, that must a trait I was born with, coming from original Upstate NY farm stock! Sheep? Goats? Small cows? I am still cautious, if not leery of strangers, even can become nippy when approached too fast by a stranger. So it looks like I am to be fixture here in this fosterhome. Ok with me. But then, dogs have been found and adopted from this fosterhome after 2-3 years here. I would set a record.   Zak speaking: ""Seems I have become what they call a ""foster failure"" - meaning they just cannot find a home that I would fit in..Or maybe they just don't want to let me go, worry that I might not adjust , end up in a shelter, on a chain, or in a stable with cows.All those things that foster parents worry about. Also, I have become very attached to this home, and while I do not mingle well with small dogs, especially fesity small dogs, I do get along. Still jumping in trhe air for fun, but I walk ok on leash. Not so sure about strangers, and that makes it difficult to ""show"" me to potential adopters. I love the open space here and the freedom to run and explore my territory. And also watch for unusual activities. But mostly I am a affectionate indoor dog. Love my crate, good food, and watching the outdoors from my deck perch. Will post some new photos, although I really have not changed much. Read more at: http://ifweb.us/rescueadopt/zak/zak2013.htm     Zack is 3 1/2 years old, just left puppyhood behind. Still he is an exuberant dog, always ready for rough playing, especially jumping into the air. He thinks he is agility material, although he likely comes from farm/herding stock. He has what is needed to keep order among a moving congregation, but only in a safe family environment.     He was purchased from a local farm, but went through 2 homes before coming to this foster home at age 6 months. Most likely due to his exuberance which is intimidating to smaller dogs. Exceptions are courageous equally playful dogs of any size (not under 15 lbs though).  He does not have a mean bone in him, just so darn much energy. His passion is chasing water from a garden hose.  With strangers he is shy, even protective/aggressive. Very alert, watchful. Basically he is still a fearful pup.  He walks well on leash, but he is easily distracted by neighborhood dogs and even little goats.  Although he is a high energy dog when free to run and play outdoors, he loves the indoors. He is mischievous and very curious and cannot be to be given free run indoors without close supervision.  He spends short periods of time outside, but always returns quickly to his post on the deck to survey activities in the neighborhood. He does not mind rain and snow, but is not happy in cold,raw weather.  Zack has been visited by several potential adopters, but each time he was just a bit to 'in their face' to be a comfortable match.   If you would like to meet him please email us, please include basic information and we will send an application.

I have finished heart worm treatment so I have been hanging out with my foster and enjoying sleeping on my very own recliner. I do not have to share it with anyone!! I have become accustomed to all the love, attention and praise lavished on me time with my very own humans that I have decided I rather not have to share my spotlight or my recliner.

03/07/2016	Macon (NC) - Chinese Crested-Hairless Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Kingston, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Chinese Crested-Hairless. Adoption Application link: http://crest-care.net/forms.htm Macon is an 8 year-old male hairless Chinese Crested being fostered in North Carolina. He is an adorable little guy with red furnishings and a strong, stout, sturdy build. He almost looks like he might have some dachshund in him the way his body is shaped. He weighs about 16 pounds and was born in 2007.    Macon is current on all vaccines, heartworm negative and neutered.   Macon is the father of Milo who is also up for adoption. Although Macon and Milo have been together for quite some time, it is not necessary that they be adopted together.    Before Macon came into rescue, he was living outside! He is now an indoor dog and loving it! He has adjusted quite nicely to the house and is totally crate trained. He has not had any accidents inside, but is usually supervised when loose in the house. Macon is a very loving silly little guy who wants nothing more than to be loved. He is a totally laid back, low-energy dog once he integrates into the family. Macon is more of a follower—not a leader. He gets along well with other dogs and looks to other dogs for guidance. When Macon is placed by himself, he becomes rather timid and unsure of himself. He would do well in a household with another dog that could guide him. He does not walk too well on a leash if he is walking by himself, but, again, does much better when he can follow another dog. I do not know how Macon behaves around children, but he would probably do ok with older children, but best with adults.   He will at times make sounds that I never heard come out of a dog and totally indescribable. Quite unique indeed! He doesn’t bark much but when he does, you will hear quite a hefty, hearty bark that will definitely warn you of anyone approaching. His red-headed temper rises up when strangers approach. He will bark quite protectively and needs to be strongly supervised when around new people until he adjusts to their presence.   Macon loves his food and can be a bit snippy toward other dogs that come a little too close to his bowl. He does not have any food aggression toward people. He’s not too fond of getting baths, but is learning to tolerate them. He is quiet while riding in a car but tends to get motion sickness depending on the length of the ride. He is frightened by thunderstorms and wants to be close to his person for comfort during a storm.   When Macon first arrived into foster care, he had a very high prey drive and could not be trusted around cats or other small animals. I am very glad to say that he is overcoming his urge to go after the household cats quite nicely and the cats and he are learning to be in the same room at the same time without incidence. I would, however, still not trust him alone with a cat or small animal without strict supervision.   Macon is a wonderful little dog who would greatly benefit from individualized attention, training and love to bring out his full potential as a welcomed family member! He will repay you with loyalty and lots of love.     If you are interested in this cute little guy, please  fill out the adoption application at http://www.crest-care.net/forms/form?formid=2201&contactsformsid=975981    If you have any questions email   crestcareinc@gmail.com     Thanks for considering a rescue dog!

Adoption Application link: http://crest-care.net/forms.htmSpike is a 8 year old true Hairless Chinese Crested. His birthday is in April. Spike leads well once you get him started, a few gentle tugs and he'll move. Has occasionally marked in the house but does accept wearing a belly band (with a put up air, ""This is so awful and I'm just going to be pitiful."" ). He does know how to use a doggy door also but prefers someone open the door for him. Not a big cuddler but does give kisses. He does NOT like having his nails done so I recommend having a groomer or vet do them so he doesn't accidentally get hurt. He gets along with other dogs. He does a sweet yodel when I come home after work and thinks he's a squirrel dog. Spike has all his shots, neutered, dental done and is on heartworm preventative.

What makes her soooo special is that she's Deaf. But that's not stopping her from being absolutely amazing! She has picked up on her sign language commands very quickly and knows sit, give paw, down and no. She is doing very good at having minimal to no accidents in the house! She loves to run around and play with her foster brother, they share all toys really well. She is however, hesitant of new dogs at first so will need slow introductions until she becomes more confident. The best part of Blanche is she loves to cuddle more than she does play! Being snuggled up next to her humans or foster brother is her favorite!!!!

This handsome man is Slater. He is a sweet, but shy and nervous pooch, who needs time to learn that people are gentle before warming up. However, once he sees that you mean no harm, he’ll be snuggled up to you in no time! Slater needs a home that will continue to teach him that it’s okay to be left alone, and who will work on reinforcing calm behavior. He would also benefit from a family that can teach him how to become more comfortable around people when he has a bone. For these reasons, he is best in a home with children over 12. However, he would do well in a home with a doggie or a kitty friend! All this sweet boy needs is a second chance with the right family for him! Please consider adopting Slater!

03/07/2016	Trixie - Feist / Mixed (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Perry, NY	Female	Adult	"Posted Breed: Feist / Mixed (long coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  DOB: 11/06/11  Looking for an awesome personal assistant, then Trixie is your girl! Trixie is a smaller dog at just under 30 lbs. She is the perfect size...big enough to get in the car by herself but small enough to do well in an apartment! Although she is still working on learning how to walk on a leash she is picking it up really quickly with the help of one of her foster siblings. She loves to follow you around but she will follow you around but is also happy to slip into her crate for a bit of quiet time or a snack break. She will gently take small treats and is quickly learning sit and come with the help of tasty treats. Getting stressed out? Trixie will make you pause and smile by pressing her head to your chest and rolling over for a belly rub. If you hold your hand out she will even pet herself by rubbing her head on your outstretched hand. Just try not smiling at her, seriously, I bet you can't, she is always there to lift your mood. She is a hunting type dog and while she has done well with other dogs of all sizes, she does not do well with cats or small animals. She is also currently undergoing treatment as she is heartworm positive. Trixie's adoption fee will be $250 to cover her spay, microchip, vaccines, dewormer, and more.  Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

03/07/2016	COURTESY POST: Boss - Siberian Husky / German Shepherd Dog / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog-Siberian Husky Mix	Brooklyn, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Siberian Husky / German Shepherd Dog / Mixed. COURTESY POST: Boss is a 7 year old Siberian Husky/German Shepherd mix but you would never guess he was a day over 2 with his rambunctious disposition and supersoft coat. Boss is a snuggle bug and especially enjoys getting his belly and ears scratched and napping in bed with his humans. Other hobbies include playing fetch, chasing squirrels, and relaxing with a nice rawhide chew. He attended basic obedience training and knows sit, down, wait, and drop it. He has been a city dog his whole life but loves any chance to play in the country.  Boss has been in a loving home since he was a puppy but is in need of a new home because his family added a baby to the pack, and Boss has displayed some aggressive behavior. He is a marshmallow with adults and despite his problems with children in the home, he simply ignores them when passing them on walks.  Boss needs a home without any young children and needs someone who has experience with large strong-willed breeds, preferably Huskies. He also needs someone who has the strength and energy to meet his need for 45-60 min/day of structured walks (and/or the finances to send him to doggy daycare). He's attended doggy daycare and boarding, and is well socialized in that environment, though he occasionally growls when encountering other dogs while leashed or in dog parks. He could be in a home with another dog if the chemistry is good, particularly if the other dog is submissive. He is not off-leash trained so would do best in a fenced environment in case of a home with outside space.  Boss is a hilarious happy boy and will be a loving companion and devoted protector for the right human family.  This is a COURTESY POST (i.e., this is not a Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue dog). If you can provide a safe and structured home for Boss and are interested in adopting, please email adoptboss@gmail.com for more information and to set up a meeting.

03/07/2016	Layla - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Layla A1049899 is a 2yr old female tan & white American Staffordshire terrier who was left behind by a friend of the person who surrendered her to us 3wks ago. Layla’s last vet visit is unknown and she currently has an ear infection which was being treated. Around strangers Layla is friendly/outgoing. She lived with a 12yr old and a 17yr old these past 3wks and got along well with them. She’s relaxed/playful and plays gently, exuberantly and can get a little too rambunctious due to her size/weight during play at times. She’s the same way with adults. The temp owner stated when Layla sees another dog “her hair stands up and she stares at them”. They believe she seems to like dogs her size or larger better than the smaller ones. When she spots cats on the street she “tries to go after them”. As far as the temp owner knows she hasn’t bitten or scratched any person or animal. When Layla spots someone with sunglasses, hats or large clothing she’ll bark and growl at them. Layla isn’t bothered by the following: if someone touches/moves her food/food bowl or treats (toys are unknown), if you move her off of furniture or being given a bath. She enjoys being brushed and petted. If you’re holding/restraining her she becomes hyper and thinks it’s play time. Her behavior is unknown for having her nails trimmed. When someone approaches the home/family member she’ll bark and sometimes growl. Layla is described as friendly, very affectionate, very playful, pushy, excitable and fearful of sudden movements and paper/plastic bags with a medium activity level. The temp owner likes how affectionate she is and Layla enjoys tugging with the rope and any/all physical activity. She enjoys balls, squeaky, stuffed and rope toys. Layla enjoys games of fetch, chase and wrestling. Layla’s an indoor dog who’s walked 3x a day where she pulls on the leash when she sees a dog or cat. She sleeps on the sofa or crate and eats dry dog food 2x a day and is given rawhide once in a while as a treat. Layla is very housebroken and will perhaps have an accident if left indoors longer than 12hours. She’s well behaved when left alone and is only placed in the crate when the family is having dinner. Layla’s known commands are “sit”, “stay” and “lay down”. Layla was taken to a dog park a couple of times and let off the leash and she’ll stay close to keep watch on you. Layla at first was nervous but once she was given treats, spoken to gently & approached slowly she allowed handling.

We are shocked that sweet Buster hasn't found his forever home yet.  Buster was part of a abandonment case in NC when we took him and his three siblings into rescue. His sister and brother have already found their forever homes and are living the life every dog is meant to live, while Buster patiently waits.  Buster is about 20 weeks old, neutered and up to date on shots. He would do best in a home with a submissive dog as he likes to rule over his pack.

03/06/2016	Clemente - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Clemente came into our care with a medical condition requiring treatment. He is sensitive to the touch and has allowed only a minimum of handling, head flipping and growling when touched. This may be the result of multiple wounds on his body. But Clemente has also sought attention, come to the front of his kennel, and accepts treats. We have no information on his past behavior, and we cannot be sure if/how his current condition may be influencing the behaviors being offered in our care. When removed from his kennel by the Behavior team, Clemente needed to be encouraged with treats. He walked with a tucked tail and low body, but showed no aggression. He avoided touch in the assessment room, increasing distance whenever contact with initiated while watching the assessor closely. But he was treat-motivated and took treats from the assessor. The assessor was able to touch Clemente gently on the back while they were walking, but even with this gentle touch Clemente turned quickly toward the assessor’s hand, body tense, tail tucked. Due to Clemente’s overall condition and his lack of tolerance of touch, he is not a candidate for a SAFER aggression assessment at this time. We recommend placement with a New Hope partner who can address his medical condition and then re-evaluate his behavior in a stable home environment after Clemente has recovered.

Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.This dog is not with Adopt-A-Dog, but instead is in the care of Second Chance Rescue, currently at the Allied Dog Training facility. See what her trainer says about her below and use the contact information provided to inquire about her if interested. Will 2016 Finally be Rhianna’s Year? Rhianna was saved almost 3 years ago from death row by Second Chance Rescue NYC Dogs . Her story is a bit of a sad one. Rhianna was used as a bait dog for the first few years of her life. They filed her teeth down and rendered her defenseless in order to help build the confidence of other dogs in the fighting ring. Then they dumped her on the street and she ended up at a high kill NYC shelter. After being saved she sat in boarding for almost two years because she needs to be an only pet and everyone knows how hard it is to place an “only” dog. She came to us for training last October where we worked on building her confidence around other dogs and getting her acclimated with the world. With still no where to go once her training was done we couldn’t bare to see her go back into boarding so Ali has been fostering her for the last year. But Ali has other animals so while it is better than boarding she still has to be kept separate. Rhianna deserves a home of her own. One where she can be free and out all the time. Before going to Ali’s she never lived in a home. She has adjusted well to home life and this girl needs someone to step up for her. Although she has to be an only pet Rhianna loves people and is great with everyone she meets. She does have a high prey drive so we recommend a home with kids ages 8 and up. She is fully trained in off leash obedience and her new owners will receive free lessons and lifetime support from us.

Guy is neutered, up to date (UTD) on vaccines. He is heartworm neg. and on HW preventative. Guy is micro chipped with a Pet Link chip.   Guy is just over 1 year old and is one of the most friendly dogs I have ever met. He loves everyone he meets, 2 legged and 4, young or old, big or little.    Since his coat is sparse, he is cut like a hairless, he looks much better. He has gained so much confidence and is learning many households manners. He didn't do stairs and doorways were a bit scary, these things are not a problem any longer. He was doing very good learning to be Housebroke but the cold weather set things back a bit; he is getting the idea and coming along.    He follows his nose so a yard and fence would be necessary or he must be on leash at all times if a yard isn't available.   Guy is waiting for his perfect home. He likes to hang and snuggle but also likes to go off on his own to explore or find a quiet place to snooze. He will cuddle in the chair with you but does not try to get on the bed at night. He finds a dog bed and settles down.

Excuse me...can I borrow your lap? I wont take up too much room, I promise. I just, well, I love to snuggle. It is my favorite pass time. I really cannot get enough. I know, I know, I am not a ""lap dog"" but can you really say no to this face? Well, maybe if you hear my story you will reconsider.... I had a family once. In fact, I lived with them since I was only 5 weeks old. I had a couple of doggie brothers and sisters - one big and one tiny. We always had little kids coming around and I just thought they were the best. Playing with them was so much fun - whenever I would see them I would just prance around and then flip to my back for a good belly rub. I love to go on walks and I really try my best to listen to everything asked of me. Well, maybe not everything. I started out every night on my doggy bed but I admit I just couldn't help myself and would sneak into my parents bed where I would wake every morning. But that is not so bad, right? I just wanted to snuggle so bad. I really felt loved which is why it hurt so much when one day it all went away.  I was surrendered to a horrible place and was immediately placed on the Kill List because I had injured my knee and needed surgery. I guess my owners didn't think I was worth it and so they just dumped me there shaking and crying as they walked away. Thankfully some of the volunteers saw what happened and advocated for me to be rescued. And not only was I saved, but I was given the best possible medical care and am on my way to a full recovery! The doctor says I will be prancing around in no time.   I really cannot wait to find my forever home. Do you think that maybe yours could be it?                "

Maggie was abandoned on the side of the road in North Carolina with her toys and a bowl of water where she stayed for 2 days until someone rescued her. She is a little over a year old and is the perfect size at 45 lbs but feels even lighter when she curls up on your lap. She tends to be more of the quiet couch potato, but she LOVES to play. She hasn't quite gotten the gist of playing fetch and loves her toys. She will bring you a toy and when you try to take it from her to play catch you will end up playing tug of war, of course if you don't try to take it from her she will try putting it on your lap until you do. She is very food motivated, allowing her to learn her commands quickly with treats. She knows sit, stay, lay down, up, & come. She thinks shes a lap dog, loves to watch TV, give lots of kisses, and she loves to burrow behind you or under pillows or blankets. Maggie Mae is a follower and a snuggler. She wants nothing more than to be sleeping on or next to you and will follow you everywhere. Maggie Mae would love a large fenced in back yard to run free in. Her energy comes in spurts so a really intense game of catch tends to wear her out quickly. She wants to be your constant companion, your reason to have a smile on your face, your best friend, and she deserves to be someones world. For this reason, she would do best in a very active home with no other pets, no small children, and experience with rescue dogs. To adopt Maggie Mae please apply at http://nycsecondchancerescue.org/app-form/

She has a good weight but her coat is missing a lot of hair, the result probably of improper nutrition and breeding. She is so delicate looking and petite, though. Well cared for and loved , Jessica will be an exquisite beauty. She has beautiful eyes, limpid, blending grey and tan. Her ears are dotted, Dalmatian style... Jessica is quite hungry, even looking for food in my bag but she takes treats amazingly gently from my hand. She sits by my side, looking at me frequently. We are friends...as I provide what she needs....food and love. She comes on my lap upon request and enjoys hugs and kisses.Jessica walks well on the leash and even eliminated shortly after we left the building. She does not seem to mind other dogs passing by. Jessica is a young adult, petite, lovely, friendly and affectionate residing right now at the Manhattan Care Center but hoping to meet you soon and be your forever bet friend.  This sweet girl is in boarding…Meet Jessica she has not had the best life. She was pulled from the ACC by Second Chance Rescue. She was in pretty bad shape when we got her- she was stressed out, had just had puppies, and had lost a lot of hair to mange. She's all better now! Her hair is back, she was spayed , and she's ready for a forever home! She wants to be the queen of her castle so a home with no other pets would be great. She’s a sup er-sweet girl who loves people. She’s approx 2 yrs old and is 40 pounds. A perfect size. She would probably do best in an adult-only home or a home with older children.

03/06/2016	Porsche - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Beautiful Porche (Porsha) is looking for her forever home. She will need a committed family who will provide the continued structure she is getting now. She would benefit with one on one obedience training, or a smaller training class as she still gets distracted due to her curios nature. She is a work in progress and is now on her way to shining. She knew very little when first getting to her foster home. Each day is becoming more of a success. This little beauty is very a ffectionate, and loves to be with you, without being over bearing. She still needs to learn her manners. She has developed respect and looks up to me and has subsided the urge to jump on me. She still needs to learn not to jump up on others, and tables. Porshe needs to learn more about boundaries and what is excepted of her. She is very athletic and fast. She needs a fenced in yard and someone who is savvy and patient. In the house, without distractions, she is doing well, She is VERY food motivated, and will sit perfectly still when petting and scratching her behind her ears. She will need to be crated when left alone while she is working on her obedience. Porche goes in her crate without a problem and sleeps through the night. She is not big into ropes, toys, balls, Nylabones, etc., but loves her frozen soup bones, or ones cleaned and stuffed with peanut butter. Outside, on a leash she is extremely curios, has a super nose, wants to check out everything. She is fixated as cars are going by, especially at night. Which is concerning. So anyone adopting her would need to be very mindful of this and be extremely careful when taking her out. She is getting better on leash. She is almost housebroken. Porshe has done wonderful with very few accidents lately. She will need to meet other dogs with a proper introduction to see if there is a good fit. Her high energy approach to meeting new dogs can make them weary when meeting her. She would do best in a home with kids who are older and mindful that she is learning to become a lady. She may knock little ones down with her energy and jumping up. She is very smart and really enjoys being treat rewarded when doing what she is told. She will sit on command, understands NO. She takes treats nicely from you as well. Who ever will put in the time, will have a jewel. really, she is a spectacular little girl and has come so far from not knowing much when she first came to us. She enjoys cuddle time and loves to be pet. She is truly a love. She just turned a year old. If you think you may be a good fit for Porche Please apply. http://nycsecondchancerescue.org/app-form/

My name is ROMEO and I'm an oh soo handsome 2 yr M Black/White Amstaff/Pit X. I'm 55 lbs of PURE LOVERBOY. I was rescued from a high kill shelter but due to unforseen circumstances, I need to be rehomed.

I'm leashtrained, housetrained and cratetrained but could use some further obedience training.

Unfortunately I have not been around cats. I also live with two 7 yr old kids but when they play rough, I get upset so it's best if I go with older kids ages 15 yrs+ or to an ""adult only' home.

Thank You Ontario Rod & Gun Club!!!! Ontario Rod and Gun Club put on a benefit fun shoot with paper targets and steel or clay discs and all proceeds going to Joyful Rescues! Their club member and our volunteer, Bob Saetta, wanted to do a little something extra. When he proposed this to the club's board he had an overwhelming amount of support and found out they have a large number of “dog lovers” in the club, and they were eager to pitch in for the cause. The day before the event people spent the day setting up the different tactical targets. They had a shotgun, pistol and rifle competition, along with wonderful raffles. They donated the entire club use for the day and all of the targets and equipment. They set a goal for the dogs, and hit the bullseye! Thank you, Ontario Rod and Gun Club! Mary was born about December 22, 2011 and weighs about 15 lbs. She is a cute little thing that came to us with two tiny puppies. The shelter said she was aggressive and understood if we had to leave her behind and just take the puppies. We said NO!!! We have never and will never do that to a mother!  As we suspected she was just being protective of her puppies. Since she was so frightened I gave up my garden bathtub once again so she could have a nice quiet ""home"" for her little family and I could work with her. Well, it only took a day for her to settle in and become just wonderful with my husband and I. She is wonderful with the other dogs and has been a pleasure!  Now that her mommy days are over she is ready to find a new human family that will love and protect her as much as she did her gorgeous babies, Pat & Terry. She is a definite lap dog. Mary's personality is shining through, she likes to run around carrying a hot pink, spikey, soft rubber, ball - too cute! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $250.00.

03/06/2016	Zeke - Basset Hound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Basset Hound-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Male	Young	"Posted Breed: Basset Hound / Mixed (short coat). I'm Kind Of Short, But REALLY Long!Zeke was born about January 8, 2013 and weighs about 55 lbs. He has been one really nice boy since he arrived. He is house trained, does well in a car, and has been perfect with the other dogs. He's also been a quiet boy, not sure I've heard him bark yet. He does need to be leashed or fenced as he can have that Basset wanderlust and he will need a harness to an easy walk type device to be on leash very far as he can be a puller. We are told that he can play a little rough with cats so no cats in his next home, please. Zeke was xrayed as a pup and they found he had mild elbow displaysia in one (front, of course,) leg. But, we haven't seen an issue and it was noted he does better on food without chicken. He is here because the human baby came along and started to crawl and this made Zeke nervous so out with the old and in with the new! Most humans don't ask for advise when they are struggling, but if they had I'd have told them that giving him up is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I've known lots of dogs that didn't know what to make of the new crawling human, but with careful guidance and understanding the dogs usually adjust and do great. This same thing happened to one of our long time volunteers and by the second child the dog said ""Hey, cool, another one!""  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $275.00.

A message from TOMMY: Truth, it's not about shock value, it's about opening your eyes and let you know what's really happening out ther ... e. Many of you chose to turn away when my life mattered...I matter   My name is Tommy and I am a bait dog, one of the most horrific forms of abuse is what I have endured. My teeth were filed down and I was meant to be torn apart. I was a prop that was supposed to be shreded for practice so your champion could train and make a sociopath loser some chump change. Mutilating me didn't matter to you, filing my teeth down was all too easy for you, as easy as putting butter on toast. Dogs like me usually get tied to a tree or thrown in a pit. It's loud...deafening, especially when there are several other dogs mauling every inch of me, wanting my bloody meaty flesh....while I'm defenseless in excruciating pain. It's raw and aggressive and you violated every part of my body...every part of my soul. You have scarred me for life in every way imaginable. My body, every scar on it makes a map-- a timeline of my abuse. I've been tortured and ravaged by my own kind and the one responsible for it is not a dog. I overhead my rescuers saying i was sooo shut down. Only time will tell if I'll ever get over it.

Charlie just arrived to the big N-Y-C from the south. She looks like she may not have had the best life before coming into rescue. Her coat is dull when it should be gleaming. She has what looks like burn scars on her chest leading down under her leg. She has been a mommy too many times to count. At just 2 years old, she's just coming out of puppyhood herself. Like any small town gir l coming to the bright lights in the big city, it can be a little overwhelming! She looks to be a sharpei/boxer mix, and is approximately 50 lbs. We are still testing the waters on how she does with other dogs because we don't want to put too much on her plate as she is still adjusting to being a city girl. She is very gentle when taking treats and was happy to get some attention from the school kids while we sat in the park. Ask to meet Charlie today!                
03/06/2016	Punky - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Flushing, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel. Meet Punky, a stunning black and white blue Merle Cocker Spaniel. The shelter where Punky was brought in as a stray reported that he is 4 years old but our vet thinks he is younger, more like 1-2. Punky has an adorable pink nose and beautiful baby blue eyes. With coloring like his, he's a real show stopper! Despite this handsome fella’s good looks, Punky requires special TLC because he is a deaf dog. Due to his hearing impairment, we are looking for a special home for him – preferably just 1 person – that has experience with special needs dogs and is willing to work with him. Punky does require some training and a low-key environment would suit him best, as he cannot be startled or approached suddenly due to his deafness. Will you be his saving grace? If you are interested in adopting Punky, please submit an application at        www.nyabandonedangels.com . NY, NJ, CT, PA only for this angel.

03/06/2016	Jacob - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). We have a very special boy who needs a urgent foster home due to unforeseen circumstances. We rescued this beautiful boy Jacob when he was just about 6-7 months old after he was hit by a car and his front paw was degloved on a busy Brooklyn street. Jacob went through some months of staying at the vet and receiving critical medical care. Shortly after Jacob went into a wonderful foster home. He was quickly adopted by his foster family as they fell in love with him. He was a big goofy puppy, but he got along very well with all the resident dogs, 3 females and 1 male. The family went through some very difficult times, lost their home during Hurricane Sandy, and through it all they took Jacob back home as soon as they could. We received a frantic call that Jacob and their male Great Dane have started getting into bad fights over dominance. The situation has become urgent and the family is absolutely heartbroken, but for safety reasons we must remove Jacob and place him in a foster home to prevent anymore dangerous fights between the two males. Jacob is a absolute love-bug. He is about 3.5 years old now good with kids, he does wonderful with all the female dogs in the home, and has never had a problem before with other dogs. His family is absolutely heartbroken. Please help us by sharing Jacobs story and photos. He is a stunning boy, so friendly and loving.

03/06/2016	Moses - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mastiff / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Mastiff Mix	Brooklyn, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mastiff / Mixed. ***FOSTER OR ADOPTER NEEDED ASAP*** Moses is a breath taking boy, just under a year old, and about 50 lbs. We rescued him out of deplorable conditions where he was left locked in a room without food or water for over a week. You see the house was a host to vast array of illegal activity. When the people were arrested, he was left behind chained in the room. When the landlord came to look at the property, he need to get him out. After a string of calls, he got our number and told us we had to get him immediately or he will end up in the shelter. We high tailed it over to him and got him. Moses greeted us with the HAPPIEST of spirits. If you could not see his deplorable physical condition, you would never have known he was starving and insurmountably thirsty for a week (during our summer heat wave nonetheless). He was just so grateful to be alive, outside, and with people who care. After witnessing where he came from, we appropriately named him Moses. Moses has a heart of gold. He is thin and needs to gain some weight. Sadly, his horrific life left him with more than just hunger, thirst, and an emaciated frame. Moses is covered in old scars. We do not know where this is from. However, it is clear that he was a victim of circumstance more than once. He is absolutely wonderful with people and children. He does get along with dogs; however, a meet and greet would be required. Moses also loves car rides, belly rubs, and snuggling. He really needs a home to decompress. Due to the urgency of the situation he is in boarding. Our hearts bleed for Moses; and, after seeing him, we know he will simultaneously break and capture your heart too.

03/06/2016	Pumpkin - American Bulldog / Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Bullypit	Perry, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: American Bulldog / Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Please contact Melissa (goingtothedogsmail@yahoo.com) for more information about this pet.In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Name: Pumpkin DOB: 02/22/13 Pumpkin was already named at the shelter when we got her, but we like to call her Punky Brewster (for those of you who don't know it was an awesome show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcQNBEdrrg?)She is just like Punky, she came to us with no family, but full of quick witted comebacks and lots of spunk. Her bubbly personality spills out in her enthusiasm and energy. She likely dances and signs around the house when I am not watching her and is probably pretty entertaining if only I had a video surveillance to show you, I am confident she does a great job of making the other dogs laugh. What would her ideal home be like?Well since you are reading this, we are hoping its YOUR HOME :-) but in reality we understand that her needs may not be the same as yours. She would really need a fully fenced yard because she loves to run (sorry no invisible fencing). She would absolutely love kids, but her energy being so high, we feel that the older, the better for her. Children over 7 would be ideal for her so she can still enjoy kids, but she wont be knocking them over or stealing their ice cream cones. She loves to play with other dogs, so we really feel she should go to a home with at least 1 dog with similar energy/age OR a family that is not the lounge on the couch all day family. She wants you to take her hiking, running, agility, scent tracking, or fly ball. Punky is crate trained and we encourage her crating to continue in her forever home whenever she is not being supervised (during your work day) so she doesn't get too bored and clean your house to her liking without your consent. I am pretty confident she wouldn't be preparing your dinner for you while you are away.Wanna know the best part about Punky? She's cute! Just look at her, she is a beauty to look at, you will likely never get sick of her snuggling up to you after a hard days work. She may even be so pretty that you gain more friends because they want to come over to see her and hang out on a Friday night with a big bowl of popcorn and a sleeping bag snuggled up on the floor of your living room...can you picture it? Pumpkin can, and she tells me about all of her ""forever family"" dreams.   Pumpkins adoption fee is $150 and will include her spay, vaccinations, de-wormer and Microchip! We will also refund $50 if you take her to dog training with a positive reinforcement trainer within the first 4 months of adoption.Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

Munchy's foster mom says he is the perfect medium sized dog. He carries a toy around with him pretty much everywhere he goes, even outside when he’s taking a potty break. He loves to chase toys and be chased while he has them. He likes all things that move including ceiling fans which he leaps in the air in attempts to catch and makes ridiculous noises at. Munchy is mostly house broken and crate trained and loves going for walks. When he is in the yard he will happily chase birds for hours on end. Munchy loves all people and other dogs.The perfect forever family for Munchy is one that is active and has the time to devote to continuing his housebreaking and making sure he gets enough exercise.

03/06/2016	Alivia - Rottweiler / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: Rottweiler / Mixed (short coat). Helper dog: A1058600 Kayla came in as an owner surrender, there was no information giving at this time. The owner did state Kayla is very fearful and difficult to handle at times; she never leaves the yard and doesn’t interact with any other dogs. The owner mentioned Kayla lived with 2 other dogs in the household with 2 small puppies that she killed but, there was no explanation on why she killed the 2 puppies. At intake it was reported Kayla was very fearful and did not want to walk from the car into the facility, she had to be carried into the building by the counselors, she did allow all handling. During SAFER Kayla came into the assessment room very fearful and timid, not all handling items were able to be conducted as Kayla lip raised at the assessor on the paw squeeze item. She displayed no interest in the toy item during this portion of the assessment. When on leash for a dog interaction with another dog on leash Kayla approaches the helper dog with her body low and tailed tucked, and then exits. In light of this behavior we feel that placement with a New Hope partner who can provide positive reinforcement-based behavior modification is the best option at this time. Look: 2. Dog’s eyes are averted. Her body posture is stiff and fearful; her tail is low and not moving. She allows head to be held loosely in Assessor’s cupped hands. Sensitivity: 2. Dog stands still and accepts the touch, her eyes are averted, her tail is between her legs, body stiff, and mouth closed, and lip licks. Tag: 2. Dog is fearful but unresponsive when touched. Approaches the Assessor when the game ends. Dog is crouching, and lip licks. Squeeze 1: 4. Dog lip curls. Flank squeeze 1: 1. Dog does not respond at all. Toy: 1. No interest. Dog-dog: 3. Dog approaches helper dog with her body low, tail tucked, body a bit tense, ears back, and lip licks.

03/06/2016	Ruger - Terrier / Whippet / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Unknown-Whippet Mix	Lockport, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Terrier / Whippet / Mixed (short coat). Murph is a 32 lbs, HW- hound mix who is very shy. He was born to a stray mom as part of a litter of 9. He is the runt of the litter and we brought him to the shelter because his siblings (in foster) had begun to pick on him. He is very scared and lays in a ball in the back of his crate with his head turned away. He needs a special person to step up for him.Intake April 2015. Update: He has been with us over a month now and will now walk very well on a leash and let us pet him. He is not eager for attention but will sometimes approach his kennel gate when we arrive. Update from Foster Mom: My circle of insecurities is getting smaller every day. I am not a fan of males, but I am kinda growing fond of my foster dad. I am most comfortable on my mama's bed in a smaller room where there is less stimulation. I take treats and love when I am on her bed and will snuggle up to her. Out of the bedroom is a different story. I am skittish but coming around. I love to play outside with all my four-legged friends and my new toys!  All in all I am a good courageous boy learning to love humans! Due to Ruger's circumstances, he is currently shy around new humans and still learning to trust. Due to that fact, he is not available for adoption. BUT - we are accepting applications and if your application seems like the perfect fit to ensure Ruger will still continue to trust and learn we will work with you and the Foster Family to ensure an easy transtition. ~~ The adoption fee for Ruger is $250.00. He will come to you fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, Microchipping and deworming and flea treatment.

03/06/2016	Tyson - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). We just received a urgent call for help from a local shelter that we work with. A male dog, who was left abandoned in a foreclosed house, was found by a real estate broker early this morning. The dog was laying there not moving, covered in its own waste, the agent thought it was dead. She called the police and it was not until they arrived that they realized the dog was alive!! Clinging to life, the dog was carried out by the police and rushed to the nearest hospital. The dog, is a male, estimated to be 2-4 years old, too emaciated to even lift his own head . He has been placed on IV fluids, and heating pads, as he is hypothermic. He is in guarded condition. Every bone is his skull is visible and caved in. We have decided to name him Tyson. It didn't take days, or even weeks, for Tyson to get in this state. He was left alone, agonizing, without food or water for an extended period of time. The case has been handed over to the authorities who are conducting an investigation. We need to ask for your help, please consider making a donation for Tysons medical care, at www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/donate Or https://www.youcaring.com/the-abused-and-neglected-animals-… Please pray for our boy, and share him.

03/06/2016	Barney - English Bulldog / Beagle / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beabull	Armonk, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: English Bulldog / Beagle / Mixed (medium coat). Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.The first thing everyone notices about Barney is how goofy and adorable he is. He has the best qualities of a Beagle and a Bulldog, creating one perfect little nugget! There is nothing quite as uplifting as being created by this energetic boy, a toy in his mouth and a tail wagging so hard it makes his whole body wiggle. Unfortunately, Barney wasn’t always the handsome and obedient dog he is today. Barney was purchased from a pet store as an expensive “hybrid” Beabull dog to a family with several young toddlers. His family was promised a small dog that would be calm and easy to own. What they got instead was a 50 lbs. highly energetic and intelligent dog that didn’t want to be told what to do. Because he was so stubborn, his family let him get away with everything, instead of training him, and his behavioral problems became worse and worse until his family had to surrender him to our shelter at 10 months old. Almost a year later, Barney is unrecognizable from that puppy that was surrendered to our shelter. He is incredibly well mannered in the right hands. He has learned basic and advanced obedience training in addition to learning agility training and how to play appropriately with other dogs. He has come so far through our training program that we want to be sure that whoever adopts him will continue to help be the best dog he can be! Barney would do best in a home as an only pet to a local adult home that is willing to continue his training program. If you are this home, please call (914)-273-1674 or go online www.adopt-a-dog.org. If you would like to fill out our adoption application, please go to https://goo.gl/oUcqxk                
03/06/2016	Parker - Cattle Dog (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Armonk, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Cattle Dog (short coat). Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.Parker came to us from North Carolina during the summer and we were so excited to find this awesome dog a his forever home. We quickly noticed how much fun he was and loved getting him together with a few other dogs and watch Parker run circles around them. He loves to play fetch and like a true cattle dog can easily keep up on a really nice hike or run! We quickly adopted him out to a fantastic family that opened up their home and hearts to this beautiful boy. Once he was settled in they noticed some behaviors they needed help with so we quickly stepped in to help train Parker. After a few months of training we had to come to the tough decision that Parker was just not the right fit for this great family. While he was great with them for most of their time together, Parker is socially dominant. We believe he would be a great dog for a family without young children and who are open to learning the training we offer to make sure Parker can live the happiest life possible. Parker is house broken, crate trained, and very dog friendly. We have prepared Parker with the training needed and now we are looking for a family to take the tools we offer to continue his journey into becoming a great doggie citizen!

03/06/2016	Bell - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Garden City, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler (short coat). I am Bell. I am a 3 year old, 30 pound (I could afford to lose a couple, just sayin…) spayed female ACD. I am up to date on Heartworm prevention, flea and tick, and microchipped. And wow, my Foster Mom says I am the Sweetest Southern Bell you will ever meet. I love people, all people and other dogs. I love playing with other dogs. I respect the dominant dogs and I don't get too pushy with the submissive guys either. She says I am on even keel with doggie social skills. I am a gentle player with my Foster Mom and Dad, although I do like to dig in for good ol' game of tug of war, and when they ask me to stop, I do. Then I just go get another toy and entertain myself or play with the other pups. I am an active girl, I like to go for walks and play in the yard. I love bath time and any petting or brushing. I am learning to have my teeth brushed, and I like that ok too.  Although I am an active girl, I don't think I am up to do long hikes at this point. I have a crooked front leg. I grew up that way. But don't worry I run and play as good as any other pup. And a couple miles is ok by me. I do love food, any food. I don't mind working for it. I want to learn all I can.  I am crate trained, and settle nicely for the night. We don't have cats here where I live with my Foster Mom and Dad, so I don't know how I would react. I love everyone. But I do get a little excited when we have nieces and nephews visit and they start running. Sometimes I want to pull their pant leg, but they tell me no and I stop. Then we play with toys instead. I love to have fun, that's for sure. But I also like to snuggle from time to time. Left front leg grew kind of crooked due to a possible growth plate injury that would have happened as a puppy. Leg is currently being evaluated. But she runs and plays. Bell is being fostered in Attleboro, MA.

Although she is great with cats, Marley asks to be the only dog in and adult only home. She prefers to be your unrivaled super star. Marley is remarkably smart and is well with her training! She already knows many commands, and eager to learn more. This angel is crate and potty trained as well. For a reward, Marley will do anything, including walking on a treadmill for treats and jumping sky for a beloved. Tennis balls, ropes, and toys beware - she will destroy you if left to her own devices. Her favorite toy is a &quot;wubba&quot;, which she likes to run around with and show off to anyone that she can find. Marley loves to fetch, hike, and never tires…until you take away her toys and it's bedtime. When exhausted, Marley will fall asleep sitting up or put herself to bed in the bedroom.

COURTESY POST: Lola is a striking 1 1/2 year old pittie mix that we think might involve some whippet because she's so leggy. She weighs about 60 pounds and is a total love who likes nothing more than cuddling on the couch and getting her belly rubbed. Her foster mom thinks Fernanda would've been a great name for her because she's sweet and gentle gal who'd ideally spend her time rolling in the gr ass, smelling the flowers, and going for a swim sometimes. She is always up for a calm walk, fun at the dog park, a game of Frisbee or, best of all, a long run. Just make sure to take a pause to let her take it all in every once in a while. Lola's good with all other dogs and fine with cats but would do best in a home with no children, as they can make her nervous. Lola is spayed and UTD on her vaccinations. This is a courtesy post. If you are interested in potentially adopting Lola, please reach out directly to info@roccoandjezebel.com for more information and to set up a meeting.

03/06/2016	Pongo - Dalmatian / Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Dalmatian Mix	Lockport, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Dalmatian / Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Pongo is a lovable, unique one and a half year old Pit/Dalmatian mix.  He loves every person he meets! Big and small! Men, women, kids. You name it - HE LOVES 'EM!! He wants to be friends with every animal, but doesn't have a bubble so he probably wouldn't work with a very alpha dog that doesn't want other dogs in their face. Even though he's just trying to kiss them!  He is also fine with all cats in his foster home, and rambunctious toddlers!  He has slight food allergies, but is doing great on the food he is on now so we would suggest keeping him on it.  He has had a rough start to life, which has caused him to be scared of being abandoned again. We are working on a bit of separation anxiety he has. He doesn't destroy things, just will have accidents in his crate when left alone in the house at this time. We think with another dog in the home, and just simply being in a routine with his new family that he will settle in and lose his nervousness of being alone. He is completely house and crate trained other than that though. He goes all day and night in the house with no accidents, and sleeps in his crate all night just fine.  Pongo also has a slight balance issues. So when he walks it looks like his butt is wiggling. This does not stop him from loving life though!!! The adoption fee for Pongo is $250.00. He will come to you neutered, fully vetted, and microchipped.Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, Microchipping and deworming and flea treatment.

Handsome Ross is searching for his FOREVER family. He is just about 3 years old and 65 lbs. He had a rough start to life with no training and little to no attention. His foster family is working with him to help him learn and keep mind of his boundaries, manners and training. Ross will need a strong leader to focus on his needs and continued training.  Ross would be best in a home with no cats and kids 16+. Ross would benefit with another dog to play with as he is good with other dogs (and cats) and it would keep him busy. Ross will benefit with additional training as he can be a little stubborn - so continued training will be good for him as well as help build a good bond. Ross loves to play, would be great on runs as he has a lot of energy. He is a strong boy so exercise is definitely key to keeping him happy and balanced.

We were ab ... solutely horrified when we saw the photos of Bennys body condition. He is a a walking skeleton. You can see every rib, even his head bones are pronounced and sticking out. The shelter staff was so worried about him not surviving through the night, without emergency vet care, they called us for help.

He is a very shy and nervous boy, and so he will need a loving, patient, and gentle family that will give him the time that he needs to adjust. Once Ford knows you, though, he is a very loving and loyal boy! As he is so timid, he will need a very dog-savvy family that has the time and experience to work with him. He will need continued socialization and confidence building exercises in the home, along with basic puppy training, such as house-breaking and learning basic obedience.

We introduced you to Odie a few days ago when he was found on the side of the road unable to walk or move due to extreme starvation. Many of you expressed the s...ame horror that we felt for this baby boy. Our vet partner who is treating Odie can not even believe how emaciated he is. We wanted to update you all and let you know that he is in good hands and receiving the critical medical care that he needs. We are still deeply saddened when we look at his photos. How anyone could want this sweet boy to die is beyond words. Odie is brave, and his heart is full of love. He will get through this awful ordeal, he will beat the odds. We will see Odies return to glory, and we can just hope and pray that the evil monsters who did this to him are revealed. Please help us to continue to give Odie the medical care that he needs. Donations are still needed and much appreciated at www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/donate Thank you to all of you who made his rescue possible by sharing, donating, and praying for him. He needs every ounce of help right now.

To adopt, the very first step is to fill out an application found on our website, where you can also read about our adoption process: www.wooftowndoggydaycare.com/adopt_a_dog.   OUR ADOPTION FEE IS $250 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTEDThis little guy, Jackson, has had a rough start to life. Not only was he a stray, but he had eye surgery to correct cherry eye. After much healing and recovery, Jackson is ready for his forever home. He is a goofy, sweet, and lovable puppy who is continuing to thrive in his foster home. He loves playing with his foster sister, jumping and bouncing around in all of his “puppy play” glory. He also has some favorite toys like anything that squeaks or moves, especially a ball or soft nylabone. He loves affection, following his foster mom from room to room and enjoying being a lap dog. After a particularly long, fun play time, Jackson loves to snuggle up in a corner and take a nap. He is house trained and crate trained, and is developing his ability to go on walks on a leash. And that tongue? That tongue adds to his charming and silly nature. Finally, Jackson would greatly benefit and enjoy a beginner obedience class.    We provide as much information on each animal's history, disposition and health as we can gather. Most of our dogs are from shelters and are strays, therfore we may not have any information at all on them, or what breed they are.  We strongly believe that honesty is the best policy. We want each of our animals to find the RIGHT home, not just ANY home. Likewise, we want you to find the pet who best matches your lifestyle and interests. You will first be required to complete our adoption application. Once received, a WT rep will contact you via phone or e-mail. If it seems you are a good fit for each other based on the info you provided, a phone interview will follow. If you are renting, we require proof that you are allowed to have a pet as well as any breed or size restrictions that may exist. If you have pets or did previously, we require your vet information and we will call them to verify that your pets are in good health, current on vaccines and spayed/neutered. We require that all pets in the home be spayed/neutered unless there are health reasons that can be verified with the vet. The final step is a home visit, where an WT volunteer comes to your home to verify your home is a safe place for an animal. It is also a time where the volunteer can answer questions and discuss safety precautions. In our Adoption Agreement, we require that every animal be spayed/neutered prior to adoption this means every dog that is adopted from us will be spayed/neutered prior to going to a forever home. This is VERY important as the overpopulation of dogs and cats in our country is a sad result of too many unplanned litters!  If for any reason the match is not as perfect as we all had hoped, the dog or cat must be returned to Wooftown, not given away or turned in to a shelter. Serious fines apply to violators of the Wooftown Agreement to Adopt. So be clear about what you are signing and be prepared to abide by the contract. It is legally binding and we take it very seriously.

OUR ADOPTION FEE IS $250 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTEDTHIS IS A COURTESY POST- CHARLIE IS AVAILABLE THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL ADOPTER. HE IS NOT IN OUR RESCUE. WE WILL FORWARD ANY ADOPTION INQUIRIES TO HIS CURRENT HOME.   Charlie is a 1 yr 8 mth old neutered pitty mix.  Charlie is a very good listener. He is crate trained, house broken, leash trained, rarely barks, shares his toys, and is not food aggressive. When he needs to go outside he knows to click his leash against the door.  He has only had 1 owner since he was adopted from the Buffalo Animal Shelter at 6 months old. He is a very friendly, playful, energetic, and loving. He is very good with all adults, but is not tolerant of children or other animals. He would make a wonderful companion for a childless couple.

A volunteer writes: Lady was born , raised and lived in the same home and with the same owners all her life. She shared her days with her mom, Dorai, a Rotweiler(left with us too as their family was evicted) as well as children she loved to play with. Lady is described as playful, affectionate but shy with strangers. She would love to be in her mother’s company and they slept together at night on a large bed.. Lady is quite timid indeed, at first, then warms up to her caretaker and even enjoys a game of tag, to chase and to be chased. She nears other dogs uneventfully, even the little ones and does not go after the birds. She is known to chase squirrels in her yard, though. .She pulls a little on the leash and does her business on the way. It took me two “sessions’ with Lady to get her to come to me and sit for treats. We are pals now. She comes on the bench, squeezes against me , accepts caresses and kisses and just “take in” some peace and happiness. Lady has been beautifully cared for. She is healthy, well groomed, the right weight and dressed in a shiny ebony coat lightly enhanced with brown hues. She owns a lovely smile and very sweet eyes that she does not “advertise’ very often as she is so wary…She keeps ‘her goodies’ for the people she loves and trust…Well, I love Lady, a family dog who lived and played with kids, one who clearly will be a “close” and faithful friend, always ready to lighten up her owner’s life…Lady is at the Manhattan Care Center, hoping that you will give her the chance to be your forever best friend…

I am really cute and fun!Tommy Ten was born about August 26, 2012 and weighs about 15 lbs. He is adorable! He's a little stout thing that prances around like he owns the place. He is good with the other dogs and we are told he is fine with cats. We are also told he is good with kids, but we're thinking older would be best. Tommy has that typical ""I'm a Chihuahua attitude."" and can be timid and we believe could nip if cornered and frightened, just your normal Chia. He is house trained as long as he is let out often enough, he's fine on leash and in a car. He will mostly hang with you outside while you do your chores. He is here due to another landlord problem, the person who took him home didn't check with the landlord before and and pets were not allowed. He came to us with the name Oscar, but even now that he is neutered he will sometimes show us what kind of man he is and man, oh, man, it must be ten inches long! So, to us he will always be Tommy Ten Inch.  He's a wonderful little dog for the right home - a Chihuahua kind of home. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $225.00.

We have another horrific abuse case that we have just taken into our rescue. We are just heartbroken for this older boy. Damien was found stumbling around, bare...ly able to stand.

We know that this boy has been suffering for a very long time to get in this horrid condition. Why would anyone let an animal suffer like this? Damien is a older boy, about 9-10 years old. Who could let their pet waste away and leave a horrible injury untreated? We have rushed Damien to our vet partner for immediate medical treatment. They are not even sure that he is going to survive, his condition is critical. Again, we need to ask all of you, our amazing community of supporters for your help.

Zani's al fresco Summer Adoptions follow us on FB to find us this summer as we will try new locations to meet the needs of NYC and support the little stores:)      1.5y 40lb Bruno RI (in RI) Experienced adopters only need apply:)Its hard to know what level of activity someone who adopts a big young full of life dog expects; but clearly, Bruno’s adopters didn’t think it through before they adopted him. Originally surrendered at the Staten Island shelter, poor Bruno was transferred to Brooklyn ACC and after weeks of waiting found what he thought would be his forever family. Imagine how crushed and defeated and upset Bruno was when they suddenly brought him back saying he was “too active”. Reality is that there is no such thing as a quiet big pup like Bruno—he needs tons of exercise, maybe long walks or jogs; he needs some playtime in the yard or doggie park; he needs to fine tune all those manners that a pup his age needs to work on for a while longer. But most of all, Bruno needs to know that he’s a wanted and cherished member of a household. ACC figures Bruno’s had all the chances they’re willing to give him and they’ve put this handsome boy on tomorrow’s euthanasia list. Unless someone steps up to foster or adopt Bruno by noon tomorrow, he’ll take that last walk to that room from which no dog returns—and all because he’s a big robust pup.

03/06/2016	Tabitha Max - Shepherd / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Shepherd / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). I Am One of the Max Collection!Joyful Rescues has welcomed 28 dogs and 3 cats all to be known as the ""MAX"" collection, from a kill shelter in Tennessee thanks to a generous donation sponsoring the transport by MICHELLE ALESSI of Amherst, NY. Michelle chose the name in honor of her dearly departed dog, Max who Michelle referred to as ""a crusty marshmallow"" a little grumpy, but a sweet mush on the inside! Still, he was dearly l oved by Michelle and her late mother who now keeps watch, with Max, over Michelle and her dogs, Cleo and special needs, Gizzie. Michelle has a deep compassion for animals, especially those who are in their senior years, handicapped, or special needs. Her one request in sponsoring this transport was that we would pull at least one animal who seemed a bit of an ""underdog""; so Katie pulled two! One is a dog with a deformed leg; the other a tri-pod cat with an abnormal eye. Thank you, Michelle, for helping us save so many more lives!   Tabitha was born about April 1, 2013 and weighs about 50 lbs. She is absolutely adorable and has been very good with all of us. She is good with other dogs, fine in the car and on leash. This gorgeous girl has been tossed away and will be so thankful for a new home where she will be cherished! She was left at a shelter when her babies were two days old, guess she became an inconvenience. She was terrified for herself and her infants when we loaded them up to come here just a couple of days later. She was a very good Mom, surmounted the stress and kept taking care of her babies who grew to be strong and healthy and now she is looking for a new home that will love her unconditionally! Tabitha is too interested in cats to live with any. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $275.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.   YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES    We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list.

Zeke is the sweetest boy! He's a little ball of energy but mainly just wants to be a lapdog. He will always greet you with hugs (yes hugs) and kisses. He loves all people and is amazing with kids. I'm unsure as how he would be in a home with another dog as he hasn't had much bonding time with other dogs while in my care. He is 100% a no go for any cats. He would thrive in a home with a yard to play. He is still being crate trained and is doing well with that. He knows how to sit and wait (even for his food!). He loves long walks and frozen bananas are his favorite treats. He is the most loving little boy ever, a true blessing to be with!

She was used as a breeding dog by a backyard breeder since she was a baby. She is the sweetest baby, rather shy until she gets to know you, is very loving and affectionate. She gets along with other dogs once she feels comfortable with them. Was fostered with young children and cats before coming to Wilma's Orphans. DAISY has CDE, chronic dry eye, probably since birth. We will be seeing the opthamologist. She has been getting drops in her eye for 2 weeks to help stabilize her condition. She will have to get drops in her eye for the rest of her life if that's the dr's final prognosis. If you are interested in this dog go to  www.wilmasorphans.com for the link to the adoption application.  There is an adoption process consisting of an application, home visit, contract and adoption fee. Wilma's Orphans is a 501c3 Not for Profit rescue organization.

03/06/2016	Grandpa - Shepherd / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Whitestone, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: Shepherd / Mixed (short coat). While every single dog who is in a shelter and is in need of rescue, pulls at our heart strings, the seniors really hit us hard here. To know that they must hav ... e been a cherished pet, for so long, and now in their greatest time of need, they are left alone, confused, scared and missing their family, this just breaks our heart. Such a case is Grandpa. Grandpa was taken to a shelter when his owner had passed away and no one in the family could care for him. Alone and confused, older pets often get overlooked, and this is a high-volume municipal shelter, the chances of Grandpa making it out alive are slim. Grandpa is about 12 years old, and for his age is in fairly decent health. He will need a vet visit to address some minor issues. We would LOVE to save this sweet senior. Grandpa does well with other dogs, he has lived in a home with a female before, according to family members. Please help us to save him by considering fostering or adoption. He will be vetted and ready for home. We can't save him without a place for him to go. Go to www.nycsecondchancerescue.org to fill out an application for Grandpa.

03/06/2016	Tyson (ACC) - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Whitestone, NY	Male	Young	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Tyson came in as a stray, so his past behaviors in a home are unknown. At intake it was reported Stanford was friendly and loose for all handling. During SAFER Stanford came into the assessment loose and wiggly, he was friendly and social towards the assessor. Tyson allowed all handling items to be conducted without issue maintaining soft body language during most of the items. He was easily aroused during the tag interaction, jumping very high to mouth the leash and needing intervention to de-escalate Tyson from his state of over-arousal. He proved easy to handle during the toy test only displaying minimal interest in the toy on this portion of the assessment. Tyson can be easily aroused during tag interaction and jumping high off the ground to mouth the leash; he slowly de-escalates once the game ends and needs a distraction. When off leash with other dogs, Stanford greets with a very stiff posture, a high tail and raised hackles. He does not interact with the helper dog other than exchanging sniffs but rather explores his surroundings. The behavior department feels he can be suitable for an experience adopter and a thorough dog to dog interaction before being place into a permanent home. Look: 2. Dog pulls out of Assessor’s hands each time without settling during three repetitions. Sensitivity: 1. Dog stands still and accepts the touch, his eyes are averted, and his tail is in neutral position with relaxed body posture. Dog’s mouth is likely closed for at least a portion of the assessment item. Tag: 3. Dog gets easily aroused, mouths the leash jumping high off the floor and slowly de-escalates. Squeeze 1: 1. Dog does not respond at all for three seconds. His eyes are averted and his ears are relaxed. Squeeze 2: 1. Dog does not respond at all for three seconds. His eyes are averted and his ears are relaxed. Toy: 1. Minimal interest in Toy, dog licks, then turns away. Dog-dog: When off leash with other dogs, Stanford greets with a very stiff posture, a high tail and raised hackles. He does not interact with the helper dog other than exchanging sniffs but rather explores his surroundings.

03/06/2016	Stella - American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Armonk, NY	Female	Young	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier. Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.This dog is not with Adopt-A-Dog, but instead is in the care of Second Chance Rescue, currently at the Allied Dog Training facility. See what her trainer says about her below and use the contact information provided to inquire about her if interested. We are still desperately looking for a foster or forever home for Stella. Stella is about 5-6 years old and was saved about two years ago from death row by Second Chance Rescue. She sat in boarding for over a year and then landed what she thought was her forever home where she lived for 8 months. Stella has some uncertainty when meeting some new people and she had an incident in her home where she bit the food delivery guy. The bite was minimal and barely broke the skin but her owners decided instead of getting her the training she needed they returned her back to Second Chance Rescue. We took Stella in for training and she has been doing really well over here with us. She is actually friendly and social with people when properly introduced. She came to us with some really bad dog aggression and while she still needs to be the only dog we have gotten her reactivity under control and she has come a long way with being able to be around other dogs. Stella needs an owner who will provide her with good leadership, structure and rules so that she can continue to flourish like she is here. She is a low key girl and enjoys taking long walks, riding in the car, playing ball and hanging out with her people. She is crate trained, house broken, spayed and UTD on shots. This poor girl has been let down twice and needs someone to step up for her and give her the home she deserves. Stella is fully trained in off leash obedience by Allied Dog Training and her new owners will receive free handling lessons and lifetime support from us.

My name is BUDDY and I'm a darling 1.5 yr M Black/Tan/White Shepherd/Collie X. I'm a petite 50 lbs of SWEET N LOW. I was rescued from a high kill shelter down south. I was rescued from a hoarding situation and because I was never properly socialized with people as a puppy, I'm shy, shirky and skittish and I will run if I get spooked. Because I'm ""flighty"" I must be on a leash at all times. I am slowly but surely coming out of my shell and becoming a more balanced dog. Once I know you, I get attached very quickly but I need to find that special someone who will be patient and nuture, train and work with me to give me the self confidence I need. It would be great to go with another similar dog as well. I'm fine with cats but because I'm so shy and skittish, it's best I go with older kids ages 12 yrs+.

03/06/2016	Peggy - Pug / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Pug-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Young	"Posted Breed: Pug / Mixed (short coat). I have Freedom!Peggy was born about January 13, 2012 and weighs about 12 lbs. She is an adorable little girl that came out of a puppy mill, but baby making days are over and she's looking forward to living a lush life with humans that shower her with love and kindness. Peggy is a little shy at first, but is warming up quickly leading us to believe that she, at one time, was someone's pet. All to often humans find supposed ""good homes"" for their pets and if the pets are not spayed or neutered they can easily end up in puppy mills to sit in a cage 24/7 and this tiny thing lived in a barn! Just imagine what goes through their minds as they sit there, and sit there, and sit there, wondering where the human is that loved them. She has been wonderful with all of us, seems to have a fetish with the men in our lives, and she is wonderful with the other dogs. She will need some house training, may have been at one time, but she is doing well in her foster home.  She's a sweetie (major snugly) with a nice medium energy level and we are truly really guessing at breed. We are saddened of what became of her life, but we are happy that she ended up here so we can find you! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $300.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.    Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.   YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES    We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list.

This gorgeous lab /boxer is 4 months old and her name is Dixie (white). She is a happy playful puppies, BUT came to us because ... she has megasophagus!    Megasophagus is when the esophagus is enlarged. When the esophagus functions properly it acts as a muscle and pushes the food down the esophagus into the stomach. The enlarged esophagus prevents the food to push down properly . Therefore dogs with this disorder must be fed in a special chair or in a vertical position. Dixie and her sister Tahlula are a bonded pair and love each other very much. They are both great fun dogs and feeding them is no big deal takes about 10 minutes twice a day. Dixie is very food driven and is a total snuggle bug. She plays with LuLu and her foster sister China all day chasing the ball or tag and she is doing great with her potty training.

Therefore dogs with this disorder must be fed in a special chair or in a vertical position. It takes about 10 minutes to feed her then I have her settle for another 10 so her food digests - it is not hard at all....      Lulu and her sister Dixie are the best puppies I have ever fostered... so kind and gentle. They are easy breezy and when they are together they are completely content; so having 2 is easier than having one in my opinion. They sleep though the night, are crate trained and 100% full of love an kisses, I LOVE LOVE LOVE them .... but I am their foster mom..... so I am prejudice..     The Megasophagus has been confirmed by several vets. It is very rare for 2 pups from the same litter to have it, but they do! Because they are so young, there is a very good chance they will outgrow it, but potential adopters must understand they also may not.     We are seeking an Adopter for them!

We took him into the rescue, hoping for a better life for our HUTCH. Right now hes with an awesome trainer learning his basic commands and how to be a puppy. He adores young kids, but for his benefit, a home with kids over 12 is better because Hutch picks up bad behaviours from young kids. Hutch will need continued obedience training that is not treat based as soon as he is adopted, so that his new family can learn his behaviours and how to properly handle them. Hutch shows great to potential to do lots of fun training including agility! Hutch gets so excited to do what is wanted of him that his excitement tends to get the better of him. If you would like to have a lovebug who is good with kids, cats, and other dogs Please apply... HUTCH is ready for forever. Go to nycsecondchancerescue.org

My name is BABY CHLOE & I'm an adorabull 10 mo F White/Brindle Amstaff/Ambull X. I'm currently 55 lbs of PURE SMUSHMELLOW! I am soo sweet and gentle and very softspoken and easy going. I am shy and a bit of a wallflower when I first meet you, but once I warm up, I'm right by your side and will be your shadow. I'm currently being fostered with 4 dogs and am good with all. I would prefer to be with another large breed mild mannered dog to give me confidence as I'm a bit insecure. I can get a little snarky if another dog is too pushy with me, but it's just cuz I'm nervous. I'm housebroken, crate trained and pull just a little on the leash. I know basic commands but could use a bit more training. I've been fine meeting young kids but haven't lived with them so older kids ages 7 yrs+ may be best. I haven't met any cats but because of my mild mannered nature, I think I would be fine with them. Because I'm a little nervous, I would prefer a quiet home in the country with a nice backyard as opposed to the busy city. I'm just a SWEETHEART of a dog!

Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.        Zeppo is a very special, handsome, and huggable 75-pound hound mix who just wants a calm, quiet and cushy spot to forever rest his 7-year-old bones by your side. He came to us off of the kill list -Brooklyn ACC- there he was terrified shaking in his cell- In a home environment, he is a calm, obedient and generally well-behaved boy who’ll charm the heck out of you with his beautiful blue eye (the other’s brown).  Strong in appearance, Zeppo is a sensitive fellow who needs very gentle treatment, or else he’ll be scared to come near you [-- who knows how he was treated in a prior life!].  Though his white with black coloring could be mistaken for that of a Holstein dairy cow, he’s definitely a hound dog and therefore needs a securely-fenced yard to run around and protect -- and, of course, bark and howl at critters and fowl.  (But unlike many hounds, Zeppo craves your company at almost all times — he always wants to know that you’re there.)  He is not fond of sharing his space with other dogs-so best that he is ‘ your one and only ‘  You earn extra points if you have a hilly yard that affords him a high vantage point from which to exercise his excellent watchdog skills. Zeppo is in Greenwich, CT please email tea66@optonline.net

03/01/2016	AJ - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	New York, NY	Male	Senior	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Saved off the euth list at the NYC kill shelter...      A Manhattan volunteer: AJ's social life is coming ahead in leaps and bounds and now he's always at the front of his kennel and eager to head out with his person, no fear of the leash at all. He's upset in his cage but outside he's a great walker and very calm, friendly and easy to handle. I was able to give him a good full body massage last night and got nothing but tail wags in response. What a shame that just as he's coming out of his shell AJ should start to sniffle (he is barely sick) and be rushed to the list. He'd be a great pet for a patient home and check out his notes--  AJ offers a few bows and is soft bodied when engaging with the female helper dog--looks like he's open to meeting a new girlfriend too! This beautiful boy is trying so hard to be 'adoptable', is there someone out there who can reward him with a loving home?                 
02/28/2016	Susie - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Flushing, NY	Female	Senior	Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel.    Meet SUSIE! This gentle, senior, female Cocker Spaniel was surrendered to the Brooklyn shelter after her previous owner became ill. Susie’s current foster mom recently had surgery and is no longer able to care for her so we are trying to secure another one for her asap. Susie is a Velcro Cocker and will follow you around from room to room. She’s a big lover and kisser and would do well with another senior dog. We believe Susie may be hearing impaired which causes some nervousness. She has a bit of separation anxiety so she must be in the same room, or at least in eye sight of her foster parent. Even when she eats her meals, Susie will look to make sure her foster mom is nearby. No need to fret… she doesn’t destroy things or bark incessantly… she just insists on being your shadow because she has lots of love to give! Susie is fully vetted, spayed, up to date with all her shots, tested negative for heartworm, and microchipped. Susie will be professionally groomed and will go to her next home with a new leash and collar set.

My name is JD and I was surrendered back to the shelter January 2016. I am a 6 year old neutered male Pit mix. I may be a big boy, but don’t let my size fool you! I am the biggest baby here! Once I run my energy off I am extremely relaxed and I just want to sit in your lap. I love to meet new people, and I seem to be just fine with a lot of the dogs I have met also. I have been around children, but if you have children the staff requires that a meet and greet is set up. Here at the shelter my favorite thing to do is run in the dog yard with my friends then come in for a nice cuddly with the staff. I would love to have a home of my own.Adoption Process: HAHS has an adoption application that you can fill out if you are interested in one of our animals.

Oh my, what became of my life?Josi was born about September 16, 2004 and weighs about 75 lbs., it's rather hard to tell right now as there is so much fur which we'll be managing to improve...somehow.  This poor elder lady was left in a home just filled with cockroaches to the point that the finders of the dog took her to a car wash to bathe her since the roaches and their eggs are likely to be in so much fur.  Her owner ended up in a nursing home and won't be coming back so Josi came to live with us for awhile so we can find another, compassionate, home for her.  She is sweet as anyone can be and is good with other dogs and cats alike.  She did well on her two hour car ride here and we are told if she is off leash she will hang around with you.  She loves attention and affection and you will be the person she waits for at the other end of the Rainbow Bridge!  She is, somewhat, lame in the back so supplements and, perhaps, pain killers will be in her future.  She looks just a mess right now and the sadness shows in her eyes.   We want to find someone that will make them sparkle again!! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $125.00.  Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.      Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations.

Sweet little Sophie the Pug/Jack russell terrier mix from BACC is doing well at her upstate NY foster home. Her eye is healing nicely and she is having a good time playing and getting used to her new surroundings.

She is housebroken and crate trained. We are told she has not been around other dogs and needs a kitty free home but absolutely adores children. She has seen the resident dogs through the gates and was good so she will be evaluated more after her recovery time is up.

Redd's foster mom says he is the biggest love bug I have ever met.  He is a gentle soul with these big sweet eyes.  When he looks at you, you know you're the most important person in his world. Redd loves to have his head scratched, back scratched and belly rubbed.  Redd loves to give kisses and rest his head on your shoulder.  Redd loves to sit next to you on the couch and have his head on your lap, and even loves to watch television with you too!    Redd is crate trained, housebroken, loves everyone he meets, loves the company of other dogs, and is curious about cats. He walks nicely on leash and listens well off leash. When Redd needs to be redirected, he responds well to his name and usually listens immediately.  Redd knows the commands 'sit', 'lay down' and 'stay'.  Redd would make a wonderful addition to any home. He has separation anxiety so he needs a household with another dog or with a family where someone will be home the majority of the time. Redd is a big boy so children middle school age or older.

02/22/2016	Vanilla Chip - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Flushing, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel.  VANILLA CHIP is still looking for his forever home! Hello, my name is Vanilla Chip. I am a handsome 9 year old purebred Cocker Spaniel. I have experienced some big life changes recently (and learned some sad life lessons). After 8 years with a family (the only life I knew), I thought I was an integral and important part of their lives, but that was all a lie. Although I did nothing wrong, one day they simply disposed of me, abandoning me at an urban kill pound. Upon my arrival, I overheard the shelter staff say that, due to my age and the fact that I am male, I do not fall within a ""highly adoptable"" category of pet. So in the cold pit of my stomach, I knew that I had been left for dead. Evidently all the years of love, loyalty and affection that I had laid at my family's feet were worth nothing to them at all. My heart is broken, of course. And I find myself wondering ""When love leaves, where does it go?"" This is a mystery I just do not understand, because even in the face of terrible betrayal, my own heart carries all the love that has accrued there for years and years ... it just no longer has a home. Although I am grateful to rescue for taking me in, of course it is not the same as having a family of my very own. Can you offer my heart a place to rest and all my love a place to go? I should make an excellent family dog but only in an adult-only home or one with older kids. Although I am a bit older, I have a lot of love to give. I am partially deaf and recently underwent ear ablation surgery which caused nerve damage in my face so I'm a little droopy. I am otherwise a healthy boy and have been neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative and I'm current on all shots. I will even be treated to a dental and a professional grooming prior to going home. If you would like to adopt or foster me, please visit http://www.nyabandonedangels.com/ to complete an online application. I will be waiting to hear from you. Affectionately yours, Vanilla Chip XXOO                 "

Amiya is a great dog. This female bulldog/boxer mix is a wonderful girl. Amiya has been receiving positive reinforcement (reward based) training from her foster, and this has been effective in teaching her basic commands such as 'down', 'sit' and 'stay'. She currently weighs 65 pounds. She started heartworm treatment last week, so must be kept quiet with limited activity. She is good with people, cats unknown. She is not a fan of being in a crate, and often has to be bribed to go there. Crate training is a work in progress.

Apply to foster or adopt Avon!     Saved from the high kill NYC shelter...      A volunteer writes: Avon is the most beautiful girl with such a soft personality! When I first approached her cage she was vocal, but in retrospect she must’ve just been telling me how she couldn’t wait to meet me! She thrives on human contact and wants nothing more than to hug (she’ll gently prop her paws up on me and seems like she could stay there forever!), kiss, and wag her tail as she tells me, with her eyes this time, how happy she is to be at my side. Occasionally she’s had moments where she seems a little unsure and very submissive, but overall she’s been wiggly and incredibly affectionate. To boot, she is very intelligent and well-mannered. She’s easy on leash, appears housebroken, is very treat motivated, and already knows “sit” and “paw” (though the latter often turns into an excuse for another hug!). When we met another dog through a fence she was wiggly, and finding the yard blanketed with a foot of snow sent her into the zoomies, but even with other things to be excited about, she still seems most excited about her person! She can’t wait to find one to call her own...                 
02/17/2016	Ocean - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	New York, NY	Male	Senior	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Saved from the euth list at the high kill NYC shelter....        A volunteer writes: “If you’re handsome and you know it wag your tail – wag, wag…” OK – a little poetic license with a children’s song, but Ocean is one handsome and friendly boy. His owner passed away so he was brought to our care and while he looks worried and serious, and has every reason to be, he’s friendly, snuggly and playful. Even during the intake process he had a “soft, wiggly body”. Gorgeously taken care of, he seems to be housetrained, and after some initial bouncy enthusiasm on leash settles into a nice walk. His tail wags as we walk, and when we stopped to take some pictures in the park he didn’t mind being tethered, sat for a treat before I asked and takes them gently. Ocean picked up a stick as we walked and carried it back to the shelter, dropping it before we went inside. So cute! Off leash in the back he found a toy to play with and was happiest sharing it on my lap while I cuddled him. Leaning in for petting or giving me a stand up hug and kiss, Ocean is a gentle sweetheart and I fell in love. In his first group play he engages when solicited by the helper dog. Ocean is doing a fabulous job in a situation we would likely fall apart in…he lost his person and then his home, thrust into a difficult new environment. He’s an awesome dog, clearly a beloved companion and deserves to have that status again. He’s waiting to meet you and ready to wag his way home.

Brandy was saved from a high kill shelter with her sister Kali. They are both around 6 years old, and bonded. They must be adopted together. They are up to date on shots and have been spayed.

02/14/2016	Sky - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Binghamton, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Beautiful Sky just turned 4 years old and is hanging out in her PA foster home until her ship comes in and she goes off to her forever home. Sky originally came to us when her family was evicted and could no longer care for her.   She is a smart girl - she knows sit, give paw, down - and is doing pretty good with stay & come. She's currently living with her foster siblings which include both doggies & kitties. She is pretty much non reactive to other dogs she has met or comes across and she does tend to like the kitties. She likes to kiss them and sometimes will try to play chase them, so we are working on curbing that only due to her size compared to them.   Sky is learning to share and brushing up on her good girl manners.  Sky certainly enjoys company and would love a home with some one who works from home or is home a lot. She is doing well with her consistent routine & structured environment. She walks well on leash and also loves to run free in the yard she has access to. She loves to go for rides in the car especially when she ends up at the park!

02/10/2016	Katie - American Pit Bull Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Perry, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier. In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file.  Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting.  If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications.  You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us.  We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  COURTESY POST:  HELP ME FIND KATIE'S FOREVER HOME! She is 2 yrs old, spayed and up to date on vaccinations. She knows all her basic obedience and then some. She walks great on a leash. She's a sweet, attention-loving girl. I met Katie this past Spring and worked on training with her for months. She is so smart and made amazing progress. She has been in a foster home but her time there is almost up, and we really need to find her a forever home. Her owner has been financially supporting her and will do so until she finds her forever home. I will offer lifetime training for her, but she needs a stable environment to work effectively with her. She needs a home!! She is such a great dog I really would keep her myself, but she is mildly reactive to other dogs, and I have 2 of my own. I don't have the best home situation for her, and she deserves the best. Her biggest challenges are jumping (for attention) and chewing (she needs enough physical exercise and mental stimulation). I can help with both of these! She is located near Buffalo NY. Anyone interested should contact me Vicki Eberle, trainer, directly at 716-523-2344. You may also email me at viceberle928@gmail.com. Please share this and help me find Katie her forever home! Thank you!Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application.  Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog.  Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references.  This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours.  We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.)  These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue.  In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them.  So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered.  This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation.  We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class.  This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home.  Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog.  We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1.  I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property.  Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk.  Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees?  If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for.  When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an 'adoptable' status.  We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs.  Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs.  Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted.  Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss.  If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3.  Can I meet the dog before the home visit?  Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance.  The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits.  We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs.  This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process.  Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs.  We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned.  Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event.  We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs.  Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and 'alpha' or 'dominance' based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs.  Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs.  Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do.  Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

Adopt Bingo!  Saved from the NYC high kill shelter....   Bingo has safely arrived at our vet partner.    Our Vet has confirmed that the open wound on Bingos back is from Bingo being burned .     Bingo is in pain and will require extensive laser treatments to heal the burn.  Bingo a 9 year old senior.   We are just grateful that we rescued Bingo and we are able to help him...       A Manhattan shelter volunteer:  ""I so feel for Bingo, an elderly gentleman who did not enjoy the best care. He is calm and collected in his kennel, hoping that a volunteer will see the sign on his door: housetrained, please, take me out. Indeed, Bingo does his business as soon as he hits the street or the yard. No marking involved. He walks quite nicely on the leash and manages very well the stairs. Dogs are met on the way and although Bingo was a little uncomfortable with his peers in a playgroup, we encountered no issue nearing them. Bingo is quite hungry but with proper feeding, his craving for food did lessen. He can sit–and even stands briefly on his hinds–for treats. He is a low key kind of guy, going with the flow, who likes to be caressed and enjoys gentle words. Bingo is really cute and innocent looking. His adorable snowy face with very dark eyes and nose give him quite a young look. Bingo was found abandoned in a park and stayed a few days with his finder who describes him as affectionate, mellow and nice with his 12 year old daughter and… cat. Bingo did quite well on his behavioral evaluation, is neutered and ready to go. He is not at all after winning a million, but dreaming of a safe, caring and loving home. Will you open your door and your heart to a good ol’ boy ?""                 "

Like a typical young dog he is full of personality and energy. He is a graduate of doggie boot camp and has great manners.Brock is crate trained, housebroken, good with strangers, and kids. He must have had some bad experiences with other dogs when he was a stay because he is reactive when on leash but has done well with other dogs in a controlled setting with proper introductions.The perfect family for Brock is one that lives in the country or the suburbs and has the time to continue his training and to work with him on leash reactivity.

02/04/2016	Chico - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	New York, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Chico was surrendered to the shelter with his sister “Leah” when their owners could no longer care for them. He was adopted out by a family with small children but returned because he jumped up and played too exuberantly with them. We couldn't bear to see Chico euthanized for being a happy dog so we pulled him to safety and placed him in a boarding facility where he has been living, waiting for his forever home.    Chico would do well in a home with an experienced foster or adopter, with no small children. Due to his living with another dog in the past, and doing well in the shelter playgroup we feel Chico would do well with another dog.

I'm ok with other dogs and greet them all in a civil manner but I'm more of a 'people' dog and would be happiest being an 'only dog' so I can get all the attention! I am too interested in cats so 'NO CATS' for me. I've not been around young kids so an 'ADULT ONLY' home would be best.  I'm a beautiful boy..strong and tough on the outside but a complete softie on the inside.

Our gentle giant senior Bentley is recovering from his bout of kennel cough and pneumonia thanks to his stay at the MACC. Luckily he started treatment right away and is feeling better. This senior gentleman, found himself homeless when his previous owner could no longer keep him.   A shelter is no place for a large, 98 pound, 12 year old dog, and would've likely been a death sentence, but he is now happy and settling in with a PA foster home. We know he has a slight heart murmur and will need a biopsy of the growth on his eyelid. Despite his ordeal he is a sweet boy, loves attention and belly rubs. We are told he lived with kids from 3-15 years old, ok with dogs and has lived with cats previously. Once he is fully recovered he will be evaluated further,  All of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.

Play time is a favorite time for him, but he settles down nicely. He is a little nervous at bath time but allows all handling, he just shakes a lot with nervousness.

Since I have white fur, I'm prone to certain food allergies and need to be on a 'no grain' or 'raw' diet. I am medium energy and walk well on a leash and love to go for a slow jog every now and then. If you're looking for a MUSHMELLOW to hang out on the couch and watch TV with.. I'm your gal!! Please come meet/adopt me today!

01/27/2016	Lonnie - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	New York, NY	Female	Adult	"Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Presenting beautiful Lonnie!  A 2 year old, 50 lb stunner, with the most gorgeous amber eyes and caramel coat you'll ever see. PEOPLE and KID friendly, her intelligence shines through in everything she does...walking nicely on leash and showing off her basic commands.  Described as ""medium energy"", not requiring hours of exercise, Lonnie would be so content with a few walks a day (or even better, some fetch!)...followed by some belly rubs and snuggles, of course.  Fun, playful, affectionate, and gorgeous, Lonnie is house-trained, not destructive in her kennel, and will no doubt be your ""go-to"" girl for play time, a cuddle, a wagging tail and smiling face whenever you need one. She'll also make you laugh ear-to-ear when you see how she runs, bouncing around like a big bunny!  If you have another dog, you would need to come meet this angel (at her board & train facility -- where she was placed after she was saved from a NY kill shelter!) to see if it's a match made in heaven! Just no kitty cats for Lonnie, please :)     @allbreedrescue_vt rescue if you want more info on Lonnie!                "

Captain Kirk's life has been quite an adventure. We are not sure what his younger life was like, but when he was about 2 years old he ended up at the Yonkers Animal Shelter. There he was adored by staff and volunteers alike and was well cared for. After some time there he still had not found a home and the volunteers put their heads together to come up with a plan to get him adopted. They decided to raise money and send him to a trainer, hoping that once he was fully trained, a family would want to take him home! They raised the money and drove him to a trainer who had worked wonders with one of their previous dogs. They gave him lots of love as they said goodbye and they wished him well and good luck in finding a loving home. They assumed that while in training he would be loved and well cared for and they trusted that the trainer would be able to teach him all the skills needed to be the perfect family pet. Two years later the volunteers were told the trainer decided Kirk was unfit for adoption and they planned to euthanize him. The volunteers were confused, how could the sweet and lovable dog they knew be unfit for adoption? They decided they would not let him be euthanize and they asked Adopt-A-Dog to go see what was going on with Kirk. As soon as we saw the condition Kirk was in, we knew we had to help him. The trainer that was supposed to love and care for him had become ill and was not able to give Kirk the care he needed. Instead, they kept him in an outdoor yard where he received very little human interaction or affection. He was infested with fleas and developed flea dermatitis, losing a large amount of his hair, and went untreated for a very long time. The trainer ever admitted that one of his techniques for correction was to hit Kirk repeatedly with a cane. After several hours, we were able to convince them not to euthanize Kirk, and instead to give him to us. We have spent the past three months treating Kirk physically in addition to building his spirit back up. We believe he is now truly ready for a loving family to give him a happily ever after! He is not good with other animals, however he is in a training program with us to manage this behavior. Any family that is interested in adopting him, and receiving all the love, kisses and devotion he has saved up, will be given free training instruction for his life upon adoption. We want to make sure where Kirk goes next on his adventure, he gets everything he deserves and never has to know abuse or shelter life again.

Our beautiful caramel girl Sandy is just under 4 1/2 years old and sadly, has never her own family. Sandy is fairly easy to please as we got her regular doggy-routine from her foster mom ""Sandy likes to go for a little hike each morning chasing a bird here or there before having breakfast. Then it's a quick game of fetch if she is interested that day. (Some days I toss, she chases it and then runs back extremely proud with no ball.) Her favorite toy is her squeaky pink piggy ball. Next up is frog hunting (she hasn't caught one yet, but she did catch a mole).   Sandy enjoys snuggles on the couch or just laying in her bed with a new toy and is so content just having people near. She absolutely loves to be hugged and held close. (She burrows her head into you and tries to get as close as possible when you hug her)"".  She is very quiet, just a bark to let you know she has to go potty as she is very housebroken. She walks well on leash and is very eager to please. She loves to go for car rides and is a perfect riding companion.   Sandy has been doing well learning that doggie friends can be a good thing with some slow interactions and meetings. She is good with older kids 12+ as she is very strong and prefers a kittie free home!

Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.This sweet boy is a lovable giant! We recently transferred Squirrel and his brother Moose from Groton, CT. They had been surrendered due to their family being relocated. Squirrel & Moose were very well taken care of & you can just tell by spending sometime with them that their family truly cared for them. Squirrel like all typical shepherds is very protective of his family and home. We are looking for a family with shepherd experience that knows and understand the breeds typical traits. Squirrel loves cars rides, playing fetch, and swimming! He is actually a much better swimmer than his brother Moose & loves to show off! Squirrel knows basic obedience well like sit, stay, down, and paw. Due to his size we are looking to place him with older children. We can tell their family mostly let them run free so Squirrel doesn't have great leash manners but with the right walking gear and some practice we think he will do great. We are currently crate training him since he isn't the biggest fan. Due to his size and breed a fully fenced in yard is definitely preferred. Squirrel is an awesome dog looking for some to open their heart & home to him! To submit an online application please go to https://goo.gl/oUcqxk.

Poor little Poe is a dog who may never have had the loving family he truly deserves. We are still getting a handle on his on-going medical needs and running tests to find out what it is we are dealing with, but there is a chance he has an autoimmune disease causing a skin problem. We are also not sure how much he is able to see or hear. As soon as our vet sees him and is able to do a full work-up on him we will update his page with more information. Right now we do know that Poe is a sweet little guy who seems like he would do best with teenagers and up (due to his medical concerns) and he would probably be okay with dogs and cats.

01/20/2016	Bugsy - American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Perry, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file.  Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting.  If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications.  You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us.  We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Name: Bugsy  DOB: 07/16/2011  Adoption Fee: $50  I am a sweet boy who loves attention and is eager to please!  I love to run and play, but I am also a lap loving snuggler who would watch TV with you for hours.  I am not a big barker or noise maker...I am rather quiet and just want your attention and love whenever you can give it to me :)  I currently eat 2x a day, I am house trained and am also crate/kennel trained.   As sweet as I am with humans, I am in need of a home with no other dogs because I am a resource guarder.   What is that?  It means that because of my past and lack of training early on in my development, I tend to value all of my resources so much that I guard them and do not want others to have them.  If another dog were to challenge me on that, I would disagree and fight over it, so I just prefer not to share my treasured humans, food, and toys.    Other stuff my foster parents think is important for you to know:  I like to make my bed like a child makes forts.  I am goofy about my nesting and my foster parents can't stop laughing when I do it.   My adoption fee is $50 which covers all of my medical care including neuter, microchip, rabies, vaccinations, and de-wormers.  Bugsy's will require a fenced yard as well as obedience training completed after adoption.  This will help him with her manners and bonding with his new family to ensure he stays a lifelong pet!  The bonus part of this is GTTD will refund the $50 adoption fee if you complete training with a positive reinforcement trainer (no aversive/correction based training).            Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application.  Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog.  Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references.  This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours.  We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.)  These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue.  In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them.  So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered.  This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation.  We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class.  This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home.  Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog.  We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1.  I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property.  Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk.  Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees?  If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for.  When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an 'adoptable' status.  We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs.  Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs.  Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted.  Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss.  If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3.  Can I meet the dog before the home visit?  Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance.  The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits.  We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs.  This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process.  Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs.  We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned.  Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event.  We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs.  Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and 'alpha' or 'dominance' based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs.  Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs.  Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do.  Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

See Chip's HomepageGo to our official websiteYou can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hey Chihuahua fans! Meet Chip, a special little senior chi mix. He loves belly rubs, going for walks, and napping by your side. Whether it's a day lounging at home or riding in the car to an adventure, he wants to be with his people! It takes a bit of time for him to trust someone, but once he does he's a wonderful, sweet, lovable, and loyal companion. Chip needs a forever home where he'll get plenty of TLC and knows he's safe and loved. Chip is around 10 years old, 11 pounds, is house trained, crate trained, excellent on a harness and leash, knows basic commands, understands many common words, and great in the car. He can learn to co-exist with other animals if they give him plenty of personal space, but he prefers the company of people. He would do best in a home without other pets, or possibly one or two other mellow pets. He loves children, but needs supervision with them (like any dog does) to ensure positive interactions. He will have to be given an affordable arthritis medication as needed. Chip is up to date on all vetting, including vaccines, de-worming, flea prevention, heart worm prevention, and is neutered. His adoption fee is $175. Apply to adopt at www.sadiesrescue.org

Large beautiful strawberry blonde female Mastiff mix. We are still desperately looking for a foster or forever home for Stella. Stella is about 6 years old and was saved about two years ago from  death row by Second  Chance Rescue. She sat in boarding for over a year and then landed what she thought was her forever home where she lived for 8 months. Stella has some uncertainty when meeting some new people and she had an incident in her home where she bit the food delivery guy. The bite was minimal and barely broke the skin but her owners decided instead of getting her the training she needed they returned her back to Second Chance Rescue. We took Stella in for training and she has been doing really well over here with us. She is actually friendly and social with people when properly introduced. She came to us with some really bad dog aggression and while she still needs to be the only dog we have gotten her reactivity under control and she has come a long way with being able to be around other dogs. Stella needs an owner who will provide her with good leadership, structure and rules so that she can continue to flourish like she is here. She is a low key girl and enjoys taking long walks and hanging out with her people. This poor girl has been let down twice and needs someone to step up for her and give her the home she deserves. Stella is fully trained in off leash obedience and her new owners will receive free handling lessons and lifetime support from us.

Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.Winston has been through a lot in his life and is so deserving of a forever home! We found Winston at a local municipal shelter where he had been living for months. He rarely got out of his kennel, and was not socialized with many new people. We decided to bring him to our shelter to try to give him a better quality of life while he waits for his perfect home to come along. Winston is incredibly loyal and loving to people he trusts, but it takes some time for him to build trust with a new person. He is definitely worth the effort because once he loves someone it is for life! There is nothing this boy loves more than to sit at the feet of his person and just relax in their presence. Winnie has been through strict obedience training and has excelled in the routine of training. He also thoroughly enjoys agility training and taking long walks. Whoever adopts this boy will need to have the dedication to commit to bonding with him and continuing his training so he can be the best dog he can be for the rest of his long and happy life. In a perfect world, he be the only pet in an adult only home, but he does have the potential to live with another easy-going female dog. For more information about Winston, please call us at (914)-273-1674 or go online www.adopt-a-dog.org.

Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.Petey is what every dog should be: loyal, loving, and everyone’s best friend. His heart is as big as his handsome blocky head, and all he asks for in return for a lifetime of loyalty is an occasional hug. As a pup, Petey arrived at a firehouse, shut down and wounded physically and emotionally with an unknown, but clearly sad history. One of the firemen took him home and for 5 years Petey knew the love of a family. He lived with another dog and several children, always there for his family when they needed him. Due to personal problems his family could no longer keep him, and he was brought to Adopt-A-Dog in hopes that we could find him a new family to love. Petey would do best in a home as an only pet, with older children, in a family that will adore him. He loves long walks, naps on the couch, and hugging his people with a big doofy grin on his face.

12/29/2015	Brooklyn - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mastiff / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Mastiff Mix	Brooklyn, NY	Male	Adult	"Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mastiff / Mixed (short coat).   http://youtu.be/1JP2qISqLQ4      http://youtu.be/ZUInogteoS0      http://youtu.be/DeL3NO9K2hI       Brooklyn is a big boned 65lbs 6 year old American Staffordshire terrier mastiff mix who is well mannered, laid back, amazing boy. His outgoing loving personality will increase your heart size at least 3 fold. Brooklyn is a master at giving you the ""puppy eyes"" and redefines the art with his uniquely crackled spider web amber eyes! He also likes to stay classy and crosses his paws when he lays down. Brooklyn has previously lived with animals but prefers to be the only animal in the home. However, a home with other animals is an option for him.         The police found Brooklyn running in the streets in Canarsie, took him in, and called Twenty Paws. When they found him I had a large prong collar digging into his skin and has left a bald spot in its place. Brooklyn’s allergies were neglected and required treatment for a skin infection, which was caused another bald spot on his back. Brooklyn is now completely healthy and ready to be the king of the castle. He is a complete love bug and walks well with a gentle leader leash. Although he LOVES people and kids,  an adult home or one with older children would be best for him- due to his large size and goofy/clumsy behavior. A great listener, Brooklyn knows his basic commands and eager to learn more. Brooklyn currently lives with a military family and the moving around is very stressful for him and he is looking for a more stable environment.        Brooklyn will be at your feet all day trying to please you. Brooklyn is crate trained and will sleep quietly in his crate all night but would prefer to keep your toes warm in the bed. He is completely house trained as well. Brooklyn is ready to go home to a dog bed (or your bed) and safe place to roam. With a lot of love to give, Brooklyn eagerly awaits to be all your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

My name is CAPONE & I'm a handsome PUREBRED UKC registered 5 y M Blue/White American Staffordshire Terrier. Actually I'm an 'American Bully' I'm a big blue 'sexy beast' and am 102 lbs of PURE MUSHMELLOW. Look at my sweet big mushface!! I was surrendered by my owner due to housing issues but he spoiled me rotten and let me have run of the  house and sleep on the couch and bed. Still he raised me well, because I have no separation anxiety, am housebroken, walk well on the leash and am not a barker. I may look mean but I'm just a BIG BABY, a GENTLE GIANT and have a very sweet mellow low key temperament and just want to be your best bud. Since I was an only dog, I wasn't socialized with lots of dogs but I seem to be ok with calm dogs, big or small however I do love puppies! I'm great with kids but I don't know about cats. They freak me out a bit. I think I could be trained with them but best if I don't go to a home w/ cats. I'm very easy going and not a hyper dog. I need to go to a home with someone who knows, understands and appreciates my breed. Please come and meet/adopt me today!! For more info/app, pls email: CECE@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG

See Corro's HomepageGo to our official websiteYou can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.How can anyone resisit this adorable face? Corro is a tiny little guy with a big personality! This munchkin was surrendered to a local shelter with the comment that they had 'too many dogs'. Corro and his brother Milo depended on each other for comfort while there and it's pretty obvious to us they deserve to stay together for life. Corro, although a little unsure of new things and new people, is actually the bolder of the two and warmed up to his foster family first. It may take his new family a little time to bring out his confidence but once you do, you will have a friend for life! He is an amusing and fun little man with so much to offer. Corro adores his foster Dad and he can usually be found claiming some space on his lap as soon as it's available. But he sleeps quietly at night snuggled in next to his brother and gets along well with his foster siblings who are close in size. We do not know how Corro would do with larger dogs but we do believe he should go to a home without small children so he can just relax and be doted on. Corro and Milo will be required to be adopted together. You can visit his brother Milo's profile here: http://sadiesrescue.rescuegroups.org/animals/detail?AnimalID=8360552Corro is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, flea prevention, heart worm testing/prevention, and had a recent teeth cleaning.

He's an endearing, occasionally stubborn doofus with wonderfully polite manners and a friendly fascination for everyone he meets big and small. Strong but silly, he loves other dogs and when he's offleash with them he bounds, runs, play bows, snuffles and 'talks' to his friends, all while wearing the most pure-hearted and happy smile on his handsome face. He's a good walker just pulls a bit who seems extremely house trained. Because of his size and strength, it's best if he goes w/ kids over 10yrs old and with someone who has had previous experience with strong bully breeds.

See Bruno's HomepageGo to our official websiteYou can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Who doesn’t love an American Bull Dog? (start the National Anthem now!) My name is Bruno, I was taken to one of the highest kill shelters in the state of Kentucky. It wasn’t a shelter where they candy coat the lethal injection, it is a shelter where the injection is as violent as animal abuse.  I was saved by a rescuer, for a family that said they wanted me. Within two days, I was returned because they did not check with their landlord. I have been luckier than most, as I have an awesome foster but I am in need of a home without any other dogs or cats, and because of my size, older kids.  Now I know what that means for me, I may never find my home but I am praying that there is someone out there that would like to give me a chance.  I am approximately 4-5 years old, 60lbs.  I am crate trained, fully housebroken and I walk really well on a leash. I am a big snuggler. I can keep you warm on cold winter nights. I’m the perfect Christmas Gift!  The adoption fee for Bruno is $250.00.  He will come to you fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped.Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, Microchipping and deworming and flea treatment.

12/26/2015	Chewbacca Tanner - Husky / Chow Chow / Mixed (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chow Chow-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Adult	Posted Breed: Husky / Chow Chow / Mixed (long coat). I'm One of the Tanner Collection!Our friends in a Tennessee shelter were bursting at the seems with dogs and begging us to visit again so no one had to die just because of overcrowding.  We said we were sorry, but didn't have the room right then.  We were all very happy that the next week was a wonderful adoption week and so the trip was planned!  Denise and Cheryl left here at 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday for a whirlwind trip managing to save the lives of 12 dogs, 2 adorable 5 week old shepherd pups and two gorgeous kittens!  Everyone was a bit weary when they arrived here at 3:30 a.m. on Thursday, but soon their confused eyes softened into a look of understanding.  The lucky 16 will have the last name of Tanner and we are eternally grateful to Christine, a supporter and volunteer as she sponsored this trip south.  Tanner is Christine's canine companion and we are told he is very spoiled.  Every time Christine goes home from volunteering she tells him how lucky he is and she says this is his way of paying it forward.  The two nameless pups are Drew and Brook, named after Christine's niece and nephew.  Thank you Christine!   Chewbacca Tanner was born about January 14, 2009 (we wonder if a bit older) and weighs about 80 lbs.  How could we leave her behind?  Well, we couldn't once we saw photos of her out for show and tells in the community. What a ham she was acting cute and funny like a silly pup.  This girl surely knows how pretty she is!  Chewy does have some rear end weakness and will benefit from a diet and supplements such as glucosamine and condroiten (sp?), but she has become stronger and healthier with us and some good food and care.  She's very good with the other dogs, but has too much interest in cats to live with any.  Chewy is a shelter favorite, we all love her very much, but she needs her own home and own family.  The Adoption Fee for this dog is $200.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.

12/26/2015	Alban - Labrador Retriever / Husky / Mixed (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Armonk, NY	Male	Adult	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Husky / Mixed (long coat). Please contact Adopt-A-Dog Shelter (adoptions@adoptadog.org), (914) 273-1674 for more information about this pet.We first acquired Alban in April of 2012 through Double Dog rescue, at about one year old. He was a rescue out of Alabama, but came lacking the manners expected of a handsome southern gentleman. It was explained to us that he had likely never been indoors before the shelter. He was fostered for one month and then made his way north to our household.  It's hard not to fall madly in love with his charming good looks, and he is a cuddly ball of love who likes to curl up on the couch with you. He loves his pack... 3 kids ages 11-14, mom and dad, a female dog, and a female cat. He has even been trained to be gentle with our guinea pigs, but he will not hesitate to heavily pursue the errant yard chipmunk. Unfortunately, our training with him over the years has not been sufficient to keep him from breaking out of the safeguards and attacking the same neighborhood dog as he walks by with his owner on one of his many daily walks. So we must, sadly, find a more appropriate home for him who can either train him properly, or provide better safeguards. Our life just has too many moving parts to guarantee that it will not happen again.  On the one hand, he is very mellow, but he does have occasional aggression which comes out with other males and certain other situations (i.e. gets too riled up while playing). He loves to go, but still doesn't love walking on a leash. I have the best outcome using the Gentle Leader.  He is an alpha who seems to lived peacefully for the most part with our alpha female, excepting the occasional skirmish over food. He is quite food trainable, and knows how to sit, stay, come, lie down, leave it, etc.  Rather than admit defeat with Alban, I'd rather believe that we have provided a 3 year foster home for him which has greatly softened his edges, made him more mannerly, and groomed him for his forever home. He does best with a grain free food, and benefits from seasonal daily use of 10 mg of a generic allergy medicine like Zyrtec.

12/26/2015	Sprite - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Flushing, NY	Male	Senior	Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel. Meet Sprite, who's been less than spritely lately due to severely infected ears. Sprite is highly allergic to grain, which has triggered terrible ear infections over a period of many years. Sadly, the ears cannot be saved, such that he is now a candidate for TECA (total ear canal ablation surgery). We are urgently in need of donations to find this $5000.00 procedure, which is the only possibility now of relieving poor Sprite's pain. Spite is an older dog now, estimated to be around 10. He has been neutered, microchipped, is current on all shots and has tested negative for heartworm. Sprite is in need of a foster home in which to recover from surgery on his first ear once done, following which surgery will be undertaken on the second ear. We prefer to keep Sprite in one of the boroughs of NYC, as his surgery will be performed at Manhattan's Animal Medical Center. If you are able to foster Sprite, please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com, where you can complete and return an on-line application. We are also accepting donations towards his care via PayPal to recipient address donation@nyabandonedangels.com ... Please help poor Sprite find a spring in his step again. Donations are urgently needed and are tax-deductible given our status as a 501c.                
12/26/2015	Miracle - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Flushing, NY	Male	Senior	"Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel.   Meet Miracle ... So named because we think it must be an Act of God that he's survived. Miracle comes to us from Animal Care and Control of NYC, where he was turned in as a stray. He was emaciated and matted to the skin, with heavy dread locks throughout his coat. He was also suffering from a terrible gastrointestinal infection and horrible dental disease. It was originally thought he could have the parvovirus, but his parvo test came back negative (finally something in his favor). Miracle will definitely be a candidate for this year's ""worst of the worst"", a nomination no dog ever covets and for which there is no prize. Miracle is believed to be at least 10 years old and has endured a decade of neglect. He has now been shaved to the skin (revealing a skeletal frame) and has been hospitalized for several weeks on antibiotics and IV fluids. Once he regains sufficient strength, he will receive a much needed dentistry and at that time will also be neutered. In the meantime, he has been fully vaccinated and microchipped and has tested heartworm negative. Having survived by some Miracle, this special boy needs one more: a loving home in which to live out his life and be a pampered pet. if you would like to adopt or foster him, please emailrescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com, where you can complete and return an online application. Sometimes we all need a Miracle, perhaps this one is yours.                  "
12/26/2015	Willa Grace - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Garden City, NY	Female	Senior	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler. Willa Grace is an 8 year old Southern belle who lives with 2 ACD foster sisters. They get along well, even when the bossy girl gets bossy. Willa is very social and enjoys meeting other dogs. She also enjoys meeting people and will readily accept attention. She just needs to get to know you before she feels entirely comfortable.   She walks a bit stiff, but loves to walk just the same. When we first got her she could only do 2 city streets. Now she can walk up to a mile and a half. She is slow and enjoys stopping from time to time to smell the roses! But when you say the word “walk” she happily heads for the door.   She particularly likes to ride in the car and, with a little boost, easily loads and is good for the duration. I have found her very willing to get into water, so if you have a place where she can swim, it will help with her joints and weight. She is currently around 60 lbs. 48 to 50 pounds would be a good weight for her.   A blood panel was done with good results. A dental was also done. Along with a good quality food, Willa receives a supplement for her joints and carprophen for aches. Willa also takes a pill for incontinence and to stop the progression of any further urinary issues. These meds run about $62 a month.   Willa Grace needs a forever family who will enjoy her slow sweet manner. If she is to be the only dog, it would be better for her to have a work at home, retired or part time working parent. Long hours alone would be hard for her. If she is with other dogs, a dog of similar disposition and energy level would be best.   Willa Grace has a lovely disposition. She is not pushy at all, and she is slowly learning to enjoy kindness and affection. With time and patience and good care, she will be a loving and dedicated dog for the rest of her life.   Willa is spayed and up to date on all shots and preventatives.   Willa Grace is currently being fostered in Virginia.   Questions? Please contact Willa Grace's foster home at: sburke1004@gmail.com.

I need to be with another dog or with someone who is home most of the time as I do get very anxious. I walk really great on a leash and am housebroken but do go on wee wee pads as well. I am just the sweetest little dollbaby and will make you smile!

12/26/2015	Loretta Lynn - Beagle / Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle-Unknown Mix	Cuba, NY	Female	Senior	"Posted Breed: Beagle / Retriever / Mixed (short coat). But, I'm a Beagle!Loretta Lynn was born about June 10, 2005 and weighs in the 40 lb. range. Eight is the new five for this country singer as she hitched a ride with one of our volunteers that was in Nashville for a festival and decided not to waste the trip without saving a life or two.  We found a dog control officer that had a few dogs that were hours away from death and he just hated to because they were such friendly dogs. Loretta was saved by one quick phone call!   She does pull on leash and should be better with a gentle leader or appropriate collar. She rode wonderfully all the way North. She is very affectionate and will adore you!  Loretta ended up at the pound because, well, she's a beagle and if you don't contain a Beagle with a fence or keep them on leash they will wander off.  They don't mean to, they just can't help but follow their noses, it's what they were bred to do.  So, we can't imagine how unloved she must have felt when the people in this world that professed to love her forever when she was that cute puppy told dog control to keep her, they couldn't be bothered.  By the way, she ducks when we clip a leash to her collar.  She is telling us that wherever she was, it wasn't a very nice place. In the one photo you will see the green building in the back, that is where they were headed. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $275.00.  Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet.  Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.

12/26/2015	Sammy - Cocker Spaniel Dog For Adoption	rescue	Cocker Spaniel	Flushing, NY	Male	Senior	Posted Breed: Cocker Spaniel.    Meet Sammy, a 9 year old black Cocker Spaniel that was dumped at the shelter by his heartless family who claimed they did not have any time for him. This sweet boy was highly neglected in his previous home and came to us with one of the worst cases of fur matting we've ever seen. The shelter even reported that his ears were weighty and painful due to all the mats. Once he arrived to rescue, we quickly shaved him down and now Sammy's personality can really shine. Sammy is relaxed and playful. He's a bit fearful of large dogs but does well with all others. Because he once growled at a child in his old home when they touched his food, we are recommending an adult-only home for him. Sammy is neutered, microchipped, up to date on all his shots, and tested negative for heartworm. He will be treated to a professional dental cleaning before going to a foster or adoptive home with a new leash and collar set. After all that Sammy has been through in his lifetime, we're happy that his family gave him up because now he can finally begin the life he was always meant to have! Will it be with you? If you'd like to meet Sammy, please submit an application via our website at www.nyabandonedangels.com. NY, NJ, CT, PA, RI, MA, VT, NH, MD, DE

See Elliot's HomepageGo to our official websiteYou can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Elliot is around 8 yrs old and was taken from the SPCA. He was found wandering around the city, nobody came to claim this soulful guy and he was not doing well in a kennel environment, so EAB was asked to take him. He appears to have had a rough life, with scars on his legs and backend due to a skin allergy or injury. But that hasn't stopped him from loving people!! Elliot was in a foster for about 6 months before being adopted. Elliott is ultra affectionate and just wants to be around his people. The family just was not a good fit for this guy, so we took him back. Elliot is laid back and is looking for a home without small children, as they frighten him and make him uneasy. He does get along with other dogs, but would need a slow introduction - he has food/toy resource guarding issues - which can be easily managed. Please apply to adopt this awesome guy today!!
