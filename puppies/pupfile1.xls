03/09/2016	Sweet 6 Year Old Chihuahua	rescue	Chihuahua	CHESAPEAKE, VA	Female	Lola is a 6 year old spayed Chihuahua. We adopted her from a family with a small child and we are about to have our first child. Lola can be aggressive towards young children. Lola does NOT have a bite history, but needs lots of love and attention. While Lola does do well with our 2 other rescue Chihuahuas, she is very needy with attention. We feel that she would be best suited in a home without young children or small pets. Lola enjoys sleeping in our bed and cuddling. She is potty trained and crate trained, but she prefers not to be crated. She will go in her crate on her own, but when we go to close the door, she barks and growls aggressively. We believe her last owners used the crate as punishment. We are not getting rid of her because we don't love and enjoy her, simply because she is jealous and territorial with children.

He is a real sweet heart and friendly towards everyone. He is good around children, other dogs and cats. He is shy around new people, but once he warms up to him his big personality will shine. He will warn me when he has to potty. He spends most of the day catching sun and playing outside with his friends. He is a good hiking companion. I've trained him to follow off leash, however I do not recommend you trying until he is fully settled in the home and especially in high traffic areas.

About 8 months ago my dad dropped me off because I was not comfortable with the other family pets. When I got here I was extremely shy and didn't know what was going on. I didn't know what attention was so I cringed every time someone would touch me or try to comfort me, but that's a thing of the past now! After a long 8 months I'm officially ready to let you love me, take me on long walks and cuddle with you on the couch! I like treats sometimes but mostly I want your attention and to please you. Sometimes I'm still unsure about my feet being touched, but with time and patience from you, I will be comfortable with that as well. Since I really don't get along with other pets I prefer to be your one and only, but don't worry I have enough love that you'll think you have a million dogs at once!!

03/19/2016	Kikdare - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Thompsons Station, TN	Female	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed. Kikdare is a 6 week old heeler mix pup that currently weighs 6 pounds. She and her 4 siblings were born into rescue. Their momma is a sweet 30 pounds heeler mix. We can't be certain of what daddy was but given the pups size, markings and features we believe these pups will be larger than their momma. Kikdare however is the smallest of the litter and will more than likely be a medium sized adult. At 6 weeks of age, the pups personalities are just beginning to emerge. Kikdare has been termed &quot;small in size but big on personality and zest.&quot; She is in a foster home being well socialized with other dogs and children and so is off to a very good start in life. Kikdare will be ready for adoption in 3 weeks after receiving her second set of puppy shots. Kikdare is up to date on shots and preventatives and is microchipped.  Kildare's adoption fee is $185 plus any additional donation you feel appropriate. She will be adopted with a spay/neuter contract due to her size and age. Our adoption fee is set to a level to make adoptions happen. They do not cover our costs. Thank you for your generosity and interest in our dogs!   All dogs adopted locally through SGDR receive a free six week session of obedience classes and a lifetime of behavior support through our Project REWARD program with trainer Charlotte Blake. You must have an approved application before being able to visit a dog.

03/19/2016	Tom - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Houston, TX	Male	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Hello I am Tom. I am believed to be a 2 year old Pit Bull mix. I was rescued by some great ADORE Houston volunteers, and I love them everyday for it. I didn't always have the best life, but I am looking for what could be my forever home.  When you life is nothing more than living chained up to a run down building you start to forget what love is. I lived a life of ever changing conditions. Sometimes I was cold, other days I was so hot I would try to cool off in what little water I had. Some days I would get wet from the water that fell from the sky, and sometimes I would try to hide from the loud noises the sky would make. Then one day as I was rolling around in the dirt I noticed a new people. People I have never seen before, they looked nice. They came close to my area, and started talking to me. I began to wag my tail so fast I thought I was going to take off like a helicopter.  They came over to me and started petting me through the fence, and I was even able to give a kiss to one of them. I have never been able to do that, and I really really enjoyed it. Then, my person came out of the house and started to shout. I got scared like I usually did when he came around. I ran and hid under one of the cars, but then I saw him talking to my new friends. I don't know what happened, but he told me that I could go with my new friends. I was so excited, I've never been this happy before.  I went on my first car ride that I can remember, and I got to go to this other place where I got a bath. I think it was my first one, because my new friends said I was stinky. That's okay though, because when they were done I remember smelling all fresh and I didn't itch anymore.   I am a happy boy that loves meeting new friends like the ones that saved me. I love attention, and could sit next to you all day so I can get loved on. I am good with all the people I meet, and I am good with kids as well. I like kids, because they go outside and play with me a lot. I like toys, and I like going on walks too. I get along great with all my doggie friends, and would be great in a home with other dogs.  I am up to date on vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped. Sadly, she I am heartworm positive, but my foster family said I will be feeling much better soon because I am getting the treatment I need.

03/19/2016	Niko - Chocolate Labrador Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Royal Palm Beach, FL	Male	Posted Breed: Chocolate Labrador Retriever / Mixed. Hi Dog Lovers, I am Niko, a 5 year old Chocolate Lab who loves to play chuck it tennis ball fetch! I am well rounded, have high energy, ready to play at anytime and also know how to tone it down. I love to cuddle in bed or just lay on the couch to watch TV with my human family. No need to crate me, I am well behaved, very smart and eager to learn new things. I am loving but protective of my family and home. For most of my life I lived with my 3 buddies, A Black Lab & 2 cats. There were no children where I lived but do love them, they are so much fun!   I weigh about 65 lbs , am neutered and have a clean bill of health. I am spoiled and will only go to a home that will keep me indoors, allow me to cuddle in bed with my human to sleep and play chuck it tennis ball at least once a day. Please do not consider me if you will leave me behind alone for long periods of time. I can handle 6-7 hours but nothing more. There is no need to walk me, I get plenty of exercising chasing tennis balls.   My current human can no longer provide a comfortable home for me and though it makes us sad to part after 5 years of being together, we know it is the right decision for both of us to part ways. We both would love nothing more than to find a happy home with space for me to run around in. I promise to be loyal, protective and all love for your and yours

Bronco, his mom, Mona, and siblings were dropped off to a kill shelter when the puppies were only 2 days old.

First out the door, first back in, first to eat...just first! He is a real sweetie too and likes to check in with his human when he is out playing.

03/19/2016	Colt the Football Fan - Hound / Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Sanford, FL	Male	Posted Breed: Hound / Terrier. Colt, his mom, Mona, and siblings were dropped off to a kill shelter when the puppies were only 2 days old. That is certainly no environment for newborn puppies, so they came to us to grow and find their forever family.Colt is the little super hero. He got the nickname Bitty because he is the runt of the litter. He took a lot of extra TLC from his foster to ensure he survived. Because of his size, his littermates would not let him nurse, so he needed extra attention. He is a real trooper and such a sweet little guy. He will cuddle with you one minute and the next minute he will be romping around with his siblings. And let me tell you, Colt has no problems eating now! He pushes his way right up to the food bowl! Colt will make an awesome companion to whomever is lucky enough to get him!

He looks very much like her and has the same temperament. When the rest of the litter is carrying on, Buccaneer will sit their calmly until it is his turn.

AN ANONYMOUS DONOR WILL MATCH UP TO $1000 THROUGH FRIDAY MARCH 18th!! COME ON WE HAVE TO DO THIS FOR FIFI!! To donate: https://www.youcaring.com/fifi-539726 We saw a Facebook post…a sweet, okay VERY sweet, 4 year old, Lab/Shepherd mix was at the Downey shelter with a cast on. We contacted the shelter, she was a stray, a volunteer favorite and she had a cast. She was never sent out for x-rays, but we knew something was wrong, very wrong. When it was clear she needed out we stepped up and pulled her. She immediately went to our vet and had x-rays done. As we suspected she has a HORRIBLE break that needs surgical intervention! Fifi is one of the sweetest, kindest, nicest dogs we have met. She sat at the shelter, in pain, with a broken bone and still gave kisses and loved on anyone who would give her attention. Now she needs ALL OUR HELP! Fifi's surgery isn't cheap, but we are going to fix her up and find her a great home! No donation is too small and Fifi is SO worth it! All donations are 100% tax deductible and will go towards Fifi's surgery and medical care. Let's all give up Starbucks this week to help this very special girl!! THANK YOU!!

Well, they haven’t met me yet! I am an absolute jewel, and my name is Ruby, a Redbone Coonhound. Did you see my picture? I think this is the absolute perfect name for me, don’t you? I am 3 years old, and I totally sparkle with love! There are so many great things about me, I just don’t know where to begin…..hmmmmm. I really do have very good manners, as I am not food aggressive. I am very friendly and love other dawgs. And to top it off, I love nothing more than a good game of fetch! I can also use a dawggie door! How about that?! I do try to be the best girl EVER! I’m not too noisy, but I have been known to sing with the sirens. It should be noted that my singing is a whole lot prettier than the sirens! I love to snuggle and give kisses, but my kisses aren’t really drooly or slobbery, though I don’t mind if your kisses are drooly or slobbery. I love, love, LOVE cushy beds and will gladly sleep in bed with you, but I also don’t mind having my own dawggie bed. I really enjoy watching from the window, and if I need to, I will get on the furniture so that I can see out the window. I have been known to escape from a fence, so it’s best if you have a good tall one. As you can see from my pictures, I really am gorgeous and super healthy…..also, really humble! They say that the eyes are the windows to the soul, and if you look into my beautiful, sparkly, puppy dawg eyes, you will see that my heart is brimming with love for my person. Just know that I will look into your eyes, too, and I know that I will see a beautiful, caring, and dawg-loving person!

She’s just learning to walk on leash and still pulls a little, but with some patience will do just fine. She greets other dogs nicely and only barks if someone initiates it.  At home she cuddles under covers and likes to snuggle up close to our faces. She’s a bit of an attention hog and would probably really enjoy being the only pet, although she does get along with other dogs, more so with females. She tends to play rough and is vocal when playing, so smaller sized friends find her a little scary at first. She is pee-pad trained for those chilly days when a walk is not tempting enough. There were no accidents in the house after she was settled in, but has had a few following her spaying. We believe this has to do with the other two dogs in the house and she will soon get back to her good habits. What would Blossom need to be happy in her new home? Lots of cuddles, playtime and a good selection of squeaky toys. Louder they squeak, the happier she is. She will need some positive obedience training to help her deal with other dogs in general.  VET CARE:  She’s had a dental cleaning and is spayed, microchipped and is up to date on her vaccines DA2PPV vaccine and Rabies vaccine. Dewormed X2. Children: NO Children under the age of 12. Other Dogs: Prefers to be an only dog. CATS: NO. House Trained: Working on the house training. Quick learner. Nails: Easy to trim her nails. Contact us at Heartprintsdogrescue@gmail.com to request an adoption application for Blossom. **Obedience training is a must and a condition of adoption for Blossom with our rescue recommended Trainers Either Diamond In The Ruff training with Colleen or Carol Soul2Soul dog training in St.Albert.**

When you get to know me you can call me Shep too. The first photo shows my sister, Carolina and me. That’s me on the left and Carolina on the right. I’m her big brother and I look out for her. We live with our foster Momma in a home located in Kentucky. Our home is filled with love and furry foster brothers and sisters. We all get along great and really enjoy playing together in the fenced backyard. Momma says that we are all different and wonderful. She calls me her sweet baby boy. I just love it when she picks me up and holds me.  I’m learning my house manners and like going for walks on a leash. I travel well and always look forward to going to new places.  I am an active young fellow that really enjoys running. Playing a game of tug of war with other dogs and with big or little people is so much fun.  I have never met a cat, so I guess they would be alright when you get to know them. If you have a fenced yard and looking for someone to be your new furry family member, think of me Shep.  Or if you are looking for a boy and girl, think team Shep and Carolina!  Mr. Shepley is a young little boy that is possibly a mix of Husky and pure Kentucky Sweetness. He is approximately 3 months old and currently weighs 20 pounds. He has a gorgeous dark sable coat with white on his chest, legs and paws. His fawn colored eyebrows make him a real cutie. Check out his photos and you will fall in love with his eyes (one is blue and the other is hazel).  Shep is completely vetted (neutered and up to date on all vaccinations and preventatives). If you are interested in Mr. Shepley, please fill out an adoption application on our website at www.kydiamondsintheruff.org. He is currently living in a loving foster home located in Eastern KY.

03/19/2016	Mad eye moody - Pit Bull Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Salt Lake City, UT	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier. Hello Muggles, I’m Mad-Eye Moody! Yes, you heard me right. Mad-Eye Moody, as in the magical auror in Harry Potter. I have this name because, much like Mad-Eye, one of my eyes has magical powers. And by magical powers, I mean it doesn’t work. I am blind in one eye due to an old injury that healed abnormally but don’t you worry… the other one works perfectly! I am a 1-2 year old Pittie blend but I can’t put my finger on the “blend” aspects of my make-up. My hair is longer and more wiry than what’s typical of a pit. What I DO know is that I am a super sweet boy just looking for love. I am potty trained, crate trained and have great leash skills. I love my walks! I enjoy sniffing around the back yard and relaxing. I’m a very mellow guy and am lower energy so I would be great as a hang-out buddy. I am still building confidence so I’ll need someone with a little patience. I’m generally a submissive guy and other dogs make me nervous right now. So far, it might be best to be the only pet in the house because I don’t have much confidence around other dogs and I get very insecure and scared. I’m working on it though.  I think some time, love, patience and maybe doggy daycamp (I’ve heard it’s a lot of fun!) will help me get to a strong and secure mindset around other great canine friends. If you’re looking for a companion to show you the magic of love, please apply for my adoption at  rescuerovers.org . Tell them Mad-Eye sent you.

To Donate: https://www.youcaring.com/nina-537561 A sweet, 1 year old girl sat at the San Bernardino City Shelter waiting for a family. There she got very sick, she developed pyometra, a severe infection of the uterus, that can kill a female dog quickly and she had a massive infection in her foot. The shelter sent her to the vet where they did an emergency surgery to remove her uterus and she had a toe amputated. No other rescue was coming through for her , she had a deadline of Friday 3/11, so we stepped up! We were charged, had to pay her medical bill to rescue her and now we need everyone's help covering it!    Nina is now under our care, she is doing well and totally worth the medical expense! She is a doll, sweet as can be and will make a full recovery. Please consider making a 100% Tax Deductible Donation towards her surgeries and ongoing medical care. No donation is too small and Nina is worth every penny! She is a true gem! Thank You!!

This adorable 60 pound, purebred Black Lab is a total sweetheart! He is only about 9-10 months old, neutered, and up to date on all his shots. Having been born deaf he can get anxious around new situations or surroundings, but he is generally a fairly mellow guy! Buster LOVES being pet! He will push his head and body into you just asking for affection. Buster is very laid back and doesn't have a ton of energy. Like most Labs he is smart and easy to train.

Meet Babe! This little piggy is super sweet! Babe has had a rough life so far. She was found roaming as a stray in San Jose, and when the shelter finally picked her up they realized she had large tumors in her breasts. Rather than euthanizing her the shelter decided to give her a second chance at life and gave her the life-saving operation she needed. Now, Babe is happily recovering from her Mastectomy and is getting all the love she deserves! Having survived breast cancer herself, Family Dog founder Angela knew she needed to take Babe into our care.

03/19/2016	Goose - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Salt Lake City, UT	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Hi, my name is Goose and I am a 10 week old, male, pitt bull/boxer cross.  I was very scared in the shelter and did not like being alone, being with my foster mom and fur siblings is the best ever! I just love nothing more than to spend time with others, whether its running around playing or chilling on the couch for a movie.  My foster mom says I will be a large sized adult dog,I love my crate and am quickly learning to hold my potty for outside. I will go right in when you ask me to (and often will just run in the crate even if not asked) and will cry a little when you leave, but calm down very quickly. I get really excited when people are around so am leaning not to jump up on them for attention. This morning I ran at my foster mommy then sat next to her rather than jumping, she was really happy and gave me lots of ear scratches, so I would say I am making great progress.  My favorite game is keep away and tug o-war with my foster siblings. I get along excellent with other dogs, and even love the kitties that live here too. They sometimes run from me, but I don’t even chase them, I would rather clean their faces!  I would do best in a home that has another medium/large sized dog to help show me the ropes and continue to build my confidence. I will need to attend puppy socialization classes (so please ask the rescue if you need advice on a great trainer in your area) and continue with my training to become a well behaved boy. I would love my family to take me on adventures and include me in their daily activities.  If I sound like I am the pup that will complete your family then run on over to www.rescuerovers.org and fill out an application to meet me!

Looking for the next STAR of your family? The first step is to fill out an adoption application!    Meet BAILEY, she is a 2-year-old 60 lb. Lab mix. She is a super sweet laid back girl who still likes to play like a puppy. She lost her family to a divorce, her housemate and was dumped at a high kill shelter. Her sad face was why her foster mom chose her. She was shy and sad on intake but once put in with the 5 children she lives with, a whole new Bailey came out. Bailey already knows the commands sit , shake with both paws and takes treats gently. She loves children, other dogs toys, is house broken, crate trained, pretty good on a leash for a 60l lb. girl, She likes to give face kisses every now and then isn't a big jumper. Her only possible flaw is that she is tall enough to sniff the dinner table however she hasn't attempted to counter surf at all. If you’re looking for a GREAT FAMILY dog without having to do puppy potty training she is your GIRL! None of her pictures have been able to show how beautiful or shiny her black coat is you have really got to see her in person.  All STAR animals come fully vetted, Up to Date on shots (UTD), spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.   Please fill out an adoption application and start the process for your new family member!     AGE DISCLAIMER: Unfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don’t bring birth certificates. Sometimes we know our pets’ ages. Sometimes we don’t. So we make our best guess based on the condition of their teeth and the veterinarians best guess. BREED DISCLAIMER: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label . Microchips: For the safety of our dogs and peace of mind of our fosters and adopters, STAR microchips all dogs prior to adoption with Petlink Microchips. Please understand that all dogs MUST still wear a collar with ID tags (which include your current information) AT ALL TIMES. Please remember, our foster dogs are extremely important to us-- we will always take any of our dogs back, if for any reason you can't keep your adopted dog. Never surrender him/her to a shelter!

Daisy Rose was found as a stray and surrendered to PRBJ.  She is a remarkable, beautiful dog. Daisy does not get along with other dogs and is housetrained.  She is fantastic with people and childrend but she wants to be your only love...According to www.dogbreedinfo.com, the Jack Russell Terrier was developed in 19th century England by a clergyman named Jack Russell. This feisty little terrier was used to hunt small game, particularly fox, by digging the quarry out of its den. Breeders have emphasized its working ability, so the standard is very broad, encompassing a wide range of accepted body types. On English hunts, the Jack Russell Terriers were supposed to be long-legged enough to keep up with the hounds. The energetic and playful Jack Russell makes a good family companion. The Jack Russell Terrier is a perky, merry, devoted, and loving dog. Spirited and obedient, yet absolutely fearless. Careful and amusing, he enjoys games and playing with toys. Friendly and generally kind to children who have been taught not to tease or strike the dog. They are intelligent, yet willful and determined. They have strong hunting instincts (stronger than your average terrier) and should not be trusted with other small animals. They like to chase and explore. Be careful not to let them off the lead unless they are very well-trained. Jack Russells like to bark and dig. They tend to get restless and destructive if not kept fruitfully occupied and well exercised. Jack Russells climb, which means they can climb over a fence, they also jump. A Jack that stands 12 inches high can easily jump five feet. JRTs are not the breed for a inexperienced dog owner. This is a BIG dog in a little dogs body. The owner needs to be as strong-willed as they are, or this little guy will take over.

We hope someone will open their heart and home to these two wonderful dogs!According to www.dogbreedinfo.com the Rat Terrier was named by the preceptive Teddy Roosevelt. They were develope in Great Britain originally from Smooth Fox Terriers and Manchester Terriers in 1820. They were brought to the USA in the 1890's. At that time they were all their original color of black and tan. Life Magazine showed President Roosevelt with three black and tan Rat Terriers. American breeders crossed them again with the Smooth Fox Terrier as well as the Beagle and Whippet. The Beagle increased bulk, trailing and hunting ability, along with the red color. Whippet contributed the speed and agility and probably the blue and brindle colors. The smallest variety was derived from the Smooth Fox Terrier and Chihuahua. The Rat Terrier proved to be one of the best in the rat-baiting pits. One Rat Terrier is reported to have killed over 2,501 rats in a span of only seven hours in a rat infested barn. The Rat Terrier is a hard-working farm hand, able to rid an infested barn of vermin with no problem. The Rat Terrier is an intelligent, alert and loving dog. Very inquisitive and lively. This affectionate dog makes an excellent companion for those who will enjoy an energetic dog. They are good with children, especially if they are raised with them from puppyhood. They are fairly territorial, and for the most part friendly with strangers. Rat Terriers make good watchdogs. These dogs are quick and very playful and are not yappers. The temperament of these dogs is pure terrier. The lively, feisty, fearless nature can be found in the best of terriers. They are eager to please and respond and pick training up faster than most dogs. The Rat terrier is a very well mannered, well rounded dog. They are easy to train and very eager to learn and to please their owner. They love to go with you and to do what you do. They are also very good swimmers, not bashful or afraid and have no problem with the water. They make good farm dogs as well as excellent family dogs for pets and companionship. This hardy dog is used for hunting expeditions as well as terrier work. They are easy adjusted as mature dogs into families with or without children. They have a life expectancy of about 15 to 18 years.

Once known as the ""St John's Dogs,"" the Labrador Retriever is one of the most popular breeds in the United States. Originally from Newfoundland, Canada the Labrador was trained to jump overboard into the icy waters to haul fisherman's nets to shore. Specimens were brought to England in the 1800's by English ships coming from Labrador, where the dog's fine retrieving instincts were honed and developed. One of the best family dogs and canine companions because of their gentle, loving disposition, the highly trainable Labrador also excels in drug detection, as a guide for the blind, and service dog for the disabled. The breed is also an outstanding obedience and field trial competitor. Highly intelligent, loyal, willing, and high-spirited. Lively and good-natured, they love to play, especially in water - for they love to swim. They have an excellent, reliable, temperament and are friendly, superb with children and equable with other dogs. They crave human attention and need to feel as though they are part of the family. Labs are easily trained. These dogs are watchdogs, not guard dogs, although some have been known to guard. They have a life expectancy of 10-12 years.                "

They are typical puppies who will bring so much joy to your household.According to www.dogbreedinfo.com, the Labrador Retriever is a loving, affectionate, lovable, patient dog. Once known as the ""St John's Dogs,"" the Labrador Retriever is one of the most popular breeds in the United States.

One of the best family dogs and canine companions because of their gentle, loving disposition, the highly trainable Labrador also excels in drug detection, as a guide for the blind, and service dog for the disabled. The breed is also an outstanding obedience and field trial competitor. Highly intelligent, loyal, willing, and high-spirited.

So we make our best guess based on the condition of their teeth and the veterinarians best guess. BREED DISCLAIMER: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label . Microchips: For the safety of our dogs and peace of mind of our fosters and adopters, STAR microchips all dogs prior to adoption with Petlink Microchips.

03/19/2016	Nellie Bell - Boxer / Hound (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Sanford, FL	Female	"Posted Breed: Boxer / Hound (short coat). Nellie Bell is a sweet little lady who was surrendered to Judy from a high kill shelter. Most of her siblings have been adopted already. She loves to play and have fun like all puppies do. She had a rough start and is looking now for her forever home.According to www.dogbreedinfo.com, the Boxer's ancestors were two German mastiff type dogs, the Bullenbeiszer and the Barenbeiszer. They were later crossed with the powerful ancestors of the Mastiff and Bulldog. Early on, these dogs were prized for hunting, bull baiting, and for pulling carts. A bit farther down the family tree, Boxer ancestors became cattle dogs, and were used to round up livestock. They were also popular circus and theater dogs because they learned tricks so easily. Breeding was rather indiscriminate until the first Boxer studbook was started in 1904, stabilizing the breed standard. In spite of its German origins, ""Boxer"" is an English name that suitably describes the dog's punchy fighting style. Though early Boxers may have been quite ferocious, the breed today is a very gentle, loving family companion. Some of the Boxer's talents are watchdogging, guarding, police work, military work, search & rescue, competitive obedience, schutzhund and performing tricks. The Boxer is happy, high-spirited, playful, curious and energetic. Highly intelligent, eager and quick to learn, but can be stubborn and sneaky. The Boxer is a good dog for competitive obedience. Constantly on the move, bonding very closely with the family. Loyal and affectionate, Boxers are known for the way they get along so well with children. A well brought-up and properly socialized Boxer will also get along with his own kind and other household pets. However one Boxer owner reported; their Boxer is best friends with their many barn cats and second dog, but will chase and eat their ducks and other farm birds. The female boxer will often get into fights with other female dogs, trying to display her dominance. If one owns a female boxer and another female dog, they will get along and even play most of the time, however they will most likely fight from time to time. It has been said that the name Boxer came from the way the Boxer likes to use is front paws for just about everything. If you have ever watched a Boxer go about his business you may have noticed the way he paws at his toys, food bowl and you for that matter, in a very playful cat-like way. Some Boxers have been known to paw at their food or water bowl if they are empty. Playfully barking, pawing and playing with the bowl, flipping it upside-down and putting their front paws on the top of the bowl, sliding it around the house barking and whining until someone fills it for them. It looks like a silly game, but the Boxer knows what he is trying to tell you, he's hungry! While participating the sport of schutzhund, Boxers are known to jump up and use their front paws as if they are boxing. They are very clownish and playful and have been known to grab and carry ANYTHING around including your knickknacks if he thinks he can get away with it. The Boxer's nature is to protect you, your family, and your home. Known visitors will be welcomed boisterously. They are always keen to work and play. Boxers need lots of human companionship. They can be rather boisterous and even in old age are still extremely athletic. Teach the Boxer not to be boisterous and especially not to jump up at people. Boxers LOVE to jump. This breed is noted for courage and makes great guard dogs. Boxers have a wide use in military and police work. Training should start young and be firm and consistent. This breed requires a dominant owner. An excellent watchdog, the Boxer will restrain an intruder in the same way a Bulldog does. They have a life expectancy of 11-14 years.                "

Here is his video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtwEupiK64      He approx. 2 1/2 years old, male, vetted, and neutered. Rocky lost him home last fall when his family didn't know how to handle him and what he needed to thrive; he lost his family, his human kids, and his companion dog. Rocky is an EXTREMELY intelligent and perceptive pup that needs a k nowledgeable pack leader. He is loyal, obedient, gets along with other dogs in an experienced environment (best with larger dogs), and needs both physical and mental stimulation. Imagine having a dog who's intelligence is capable of being a Police dog, a Search & Rescue, a running companion, and more but isn't getting any of that mental or physical stimulation or training. We believe Rocky has a purpose and is trying to find his way to his forever family. He has been staying in boarding for months which is completely unfair to him but has been doing well in that environment much to our surprise. He is a stunning mix of we believe Shepherd and Husky however there is no way to know for certain without a DNA test (these are very helpful to understand any mixed breed much better). Rocky loves to go for car rides, loves to snuggle, loves to hike, and needs a loyal human pack leader.       If you are interested in adopting Rocky please fill out an Application at our website at www.Passion-4-Paws.org (pls make sure you have the Vermont site) or if you have an Application already in let us know! **PLEASE NOTE** This is a courtesy post where we are assisting his owner to find a home and do not own Rocky.       Check out his Facebook page (please ""Like"" us while you are there): http://tinyurl.com/jrwpnrk     Disclosure:    Breed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog’s DNA determines appearance!  Passion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as “dog friendly” and “child friendly” should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.                "

Online Adoption Applicaton Hey there, my name's Boss and I'm looking for my forever family.  When my foster mom pulled me from the shelter in December 2014, I was in really bad shape from pretty much being starved and I was missing more that half of my fur. Luckily my foster mom saw through all of that and knew I was worth saving.  My blood work showed some readings that didn't look good so my foster mom was going to let me retire with her. (I didn't know it but her vet told her I probably only had less than a year left). Well surprise, surprise... did I prove him wrong!  After having my foster mom take good care of me, a year later and my blood work came back perfect and I even had a major dental. Now I am as healthy as a pup and the vet said I have more than a few years left!   And I'd sure like to live that time with my very own forever family. My foster mom is very close to me and loves me lots and that's why she said she'd help me find my own family.  I'm fully vetted and heartworm negative and my adoption fee is only $250.  I only weigh 5 pounds so I'm the perfect lap size. My foster mom says I'm the perfect combination of cuddly and independent. A home visit by my foster mom is an absolute must as she says only the very bestest family can have me.  Please fill out an online application if you'd like additional info or would like to meet me - www.texaslittlecuties.org email - stacey_denman@yahoo.comWe are a RESCUE ORGANIZATION, therefore, please complete your online adoption application which can be found on our website  www.texaslittlecuties.org    We require an adoption application, vet reference, and a home visit with the pet. if you have current pets, they must be spayed and/or neutered, current on their vaccinations, and on Heart worm preventative.

All our dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped before adoption. Our dogs are companion animals that live indoors as part of your family. Please do not apply if your plan is to have them as outside dogs, garage dogs, porch dogs or outside kennel dogs.  All of our dogs are in private foster homes. We are not a shelter with hours. A visit can be arranaged after an adoption questionnaire has been filled out and sent in. Please try email first. We are all volunteers that work so we can not easily take or make phone calls.

Please contact SSRR (rottie.info.ssrr@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.                        SSRR provides FREE transport to our approved adopters.             Hi!! My name is Zora. I am so happy to be part of the SSRR family! I spent the first part of my life having babies but once I got done doing that, I found myself dumped at the local shelter. That was NOT fun, but I was a good girl there and found myself a Foster Family. THEY ARE AWESOME!!! I have 2 Rottie sisters that are about my age and 2 human foster sisters (4&6). I love the kids. They feed me treats and rub my belly and squish my face. We have lots of fun playing tug and I am a big fan of tennis balls and squeaky toys. I like my Rottie sisters too. It took me a little while to learn how to play. My foster Mom says I am really loud and I scare the other dogs off, but I really don't mean to do that. I just have a REALLY big bark. I love people and my Foster Dad lets me sit with him and watch TV in the evenings...LOVE THAT! I would really like to be a part of a family with kids. I could be an only dog very easily. I like to play with my humans and much as I like to play with other dogs, so I'm flexible that way. If I sound like I might be a good fit for you, PLEASE get in touch with my foster family and they will answer all your questions!                    Step 1:  Please complete the adoption application in full; incomplete applications WILL NOT BE PROCESSED        Step 2: Our Lead Adoption Coordinator will contact you and confirm your application has been received (please use our   Contact Us form     if you have not gotten a response within 7 days).          Step 3: After you have received confirmation from our Lead Adoption Coordinator, your application will then be forwarded to communicate with one of our Adoption Coordinators. The Adoption Coordinator is your point of contact during the adoption process,        Step 4: Once the Adoption Coordinator has finished processing your application, a volunteer will be selected to contact you to schedule a home visit. Home visits allow us to see where the dog will live, discuss any questions you have and review our adoption contract.        Step 5: Once the application process is completed, the adoption package goes to the board of directors for a 24 hour review.        SSRR is very serious about the homes our dogs are placed in and want to ensure they never end up homeless again.

03/19/2016	Oliver2 - Dachshund (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund	South Weymouth, SC	Male	Posted Breed: Dachshund (short coat). Adoption Fee: $275.00 + $35.00 for a health certificate if going over state lines (required by law). Dogs adopted in New England are subject to additional rules and regulations by the state departments of agriculture. Complying with these regulations is expensive for our rescue, and all dogs adopted in New England states are subject to an additional $125 fee to help cover a portion of these expenses      Oliver is a sweet boy who loves attention. His owners did not have time to devote to him because they were both in school and working full-time and Oliver was not happy being left alone. His owners didn’t think it was fair to him and thought he’d be happier with an owner who could spend more time with him.    Oliver has settled into his foster home with out a hiccup. His foster mom reports that because he is not particularly fond of being crated when she is away from home he is gated in her kitchen with his two 4-legged foster sisters. He has already won over his foster mom and sleeps with everyone in the big bed at night. He loves to go for walks outside and does fine on a leash.    Oliver is searching for a forever family with a doggy buddy to keep him company and a family that will not leave him alone for long periods of time.   Want to know more about Oliver?

03/19/2016	Buddy Blue - Husky / Labrador Retriever (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Sanford, FL	Male	"Posted Breed: Husky / Labrador Retriever (medium coat). Buddy was pulled from a high kill shelter - the staff realized what a great dog he is and asked PRBJ to save him. He is a very loyal dog who is well behaved, good with dogs and cats, knows commands, and is crate trained.  When walking, he likes to rub on your leg, and he loves to be cuddled!  Buddy Blue has a perfect temperment.Native to Siberia, Huskies were used for centuries by the Chukchi people to pull sleds, herd reindeer and perform watchdogging functions. They were perfect working dogs for the harsh Siberian conditions: hardy, able to integrate into small packs, and quite happy to work for hours on end. The Siberian Husky is a very light-weight sled dog with great stamina. It was brought to Alaska in 1909 by fur traders in Malamute for arctic races because of their great speed. In 1925 there was a diphtheria epidemic in Nome, Alaska and many dog teams relayed the precious medicine to the stricken city. This event focused national attention on the Siberian Husky and helped popularize the breed. The Siberian Husky was also used during Admiral Byrd's Antarctic Expeditions. An excellent pack animal, the Husky gets along well with his comrades. These dogs are gentle and playful, but willful and mischievous. This cheerful dog is very fond of his or her family. A puppy at heart, they are clever, sociable and loving, easy-going and docile. Good with children and friendly with strangers, they are not watchdogs, for they bark little and love everyone. Huskies are very intelligent and trainable, but they have a mind of their own and will only obey a command if they see the point. Training takes patience, consistency and an understanding of the Arctic dog character. This dog will take advantage if he can. Huskies make an excellent jogging companion, as long as it is not too hot. This breed likes to howl and gets bored easily. They do not like to be left alone, so if this is the breed for you, you may want to consider having two. A lonely Husky can be very destructive. Remember that the Husky is a sled dog in heart and soul. They are good with other pets if they are raised with them from puppyhood. Huskies are thrifty eaters and need less food than you might expect. This breed likes to roam. They are not usually recommended for apartments, however they can live in apartments if well trained and properly exercised. Siberian Huskies are very active indoors and do best with a fenced-in large yard. Because of their heavy coats, these dogs prefer cool climates. One has to use common sense with respect to maintaining them in the heat by providing adequate shade and air conditioning. It is a common misconception that all Siberians have blue eyes. They can have eyes that are blue, brown, amber, or any combination thereof including eyes which are half blue and half brown, which is referred to as being parti-eyed. Having one blue eye and one brown eye is referred to as being bi-eyed. The large ""snow shoe"" feet have hair between the toes for gripping on ice. The Siberian Husky has a thick, wooly undercoat and a soft outer coat. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as -58 degrees to -76 degrees F. They have a life expectancy of about 12-15 years. According to www.dogbreedinfo.com, the Labrador Retriever is a loving, affectionate, lovable, patient dog. Once known as the ""St John's Dogs,"" the Labrador Retriever is one of the most popular breeds in the United States. Originally from Newfoundland, Canada the Labrador was trained to jump overboard into the icy waters to haul fisherman's nets to shore. Specimens were brought to England in the 1800's by English ships coming from Labrador, where the dog's fine retrieving instincts were honed and developed. One of the best family dogs and canine companions because of their gentle, loving disposition, the highly trainable Labrador also excels in drug detection, as a guide for the blind, and service dog for the disabled. The breed is also an outstanding obedience and field trial competitor. Highly intelligent, loyal, willing, and high-spirited. Lively and good-natured, they love to play, especially in water - for they love to swim. They have an excellent, reliable, temperament and are friendly, superb with children and equable with other dogs. They crave human attention and need to feel as though they are part of the family. Labs are easily trained. These dogs are watchdogs, not guard dogs, although some have been known to guard. They have a life expectancy of 10-12 years.                "
03/19/2016	Dougie - Beagle (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle	Sanford, FL	Male	Posted Breed: Beagle (short coat). Dougie and Boogie and Parker were pulled from a high kill shelter.   They need a loving family that will have the time and patience to get these 2 babies comfortable so they can show you what a fantastic pair they are. Per our staff they are 2 very loving animals. According to www.dogbreedinfo.com, the Beagle is one of the most popular scent hounds because of his energy, willingness, and merry, sweet disposition. The breed probably originated as a cross between the Harrier and other hounds in England. The Beagle has been used in packs, alone, and in pairs, for hunting hare, pheasant and quail. He has also served as an excellent narcotics detection dog and makes a fine family companion. The Beagle is a gentle, sweet, lively and curious dog that just loves everyone! A happy little tail-wagger! Sociable, brave and intelligent. Calm and loving. Excellent with children and generally good with other dogs, but should not be trusted with non-canine pets, unless they are socialized with cats and other household animals when they are young. Beagles have minds of their own. They are determined and watchful and require patient, firm training. This breed doesn't like being left alone. Consider buying two if you will be gone a lot. A Beagle has a loud baying cry that was a delight to hunting horsemen, but can be disturbing to family and neighbors. Beagles have a tendency to follow their own noses. They may take off on their own exploration if let off their leash in an unfenced area. Energetic and possessing great stamina, the Beagle needs plenty of exercise, but a yard of reasonable size will take care of most of its requirements. A brisk daily walk will cover the rest. Always use a lead when walking this breed or you will be running the risk of it disappearing in search of wild game.

She is about 9 years old and 31 pounds. More info to come!     Many of our dogs are rescued from commercial breeders where they spent their lives getting comfort from their canine friends. In turn, most require another companion dog in their forever home in order for them to feel safe. If you are interested in a particular dog, and do not currently have a dog residing with you, please understand that your home might not be the right fit for many of our dogs.     ADOPTION EVENTS:     Please understand that all of our pets are in foster homes and sometimes ""life"" happens and the foster family cannot make it to their scheduled adoption event. If you are traveling from a far distance to meet a specific animal, please email us to confirm attendance.      ADOPTION PROCEDURE:      To fill out an online adoption application please visit our website   www.underdogrescuemn.com/adoption-applications     Note:  In most circumstances Underdog Rescue will only adopt within 60 miles of Minneapolis, MN.

FOSTER CARE:      All of our animals are fostered in individual homes or doggie daycare facilities. While they are in our care, they are part of our families and given lots of love. We work on training, crate-training and socialization prior to adoption. Each animal's behavior is evaluated and we have a sense of its temperament and personality. We look for adopters who will give each animal the wonderful life and permanent home that he or she deserves. If you have an interest and ability to be a foster home, please visit our website   www.underdogrescuemn.com/foster-applications   and fill out a foster application.       NUTRITION:      Nutrition is vital to the rehabilitation and life-long health of our pets. All of our foster animals are fed a premium diet such as NutriSource, Canidae, Orijen, Nature's Variety, Fromm, Pure Vita, Stella and Chewy's, Primal, or balanced raw diet. All adopters are required to continue providing premium diets for the life of the animal.       YOU CAN HELP:      Not able to foster or adopt right now? Please consider sponsoring an Underdog.

03/19/2016	Maggie - Lhasa Apso / Poodle (Miniature) / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Lhasa-Poo	San Francisco, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Lhasa Apso / Poodle (Miniature) / Mixed. Meet Maggie! This adorable Lhasa Apso/Poodle mix had a rough start in life and really needs a quiet and mellow place to call home. We think Maggie spent most of her life in a backyard with other dogs, because she is very timid around new people and will actually lunge and bark at them out of fear when she is walking on leash. Though she’s still shy when meeting a new person, once she gets to know you, she’s absolutely devoted. Maggie is eager to please and loves to play with toys and romp with other dogs. If you’re a jogger, she would be a great companion, because she’s able to jog four miles a day. If you’d rather take it slow, she’s fine with short walks, playtime and lap time. Maggie is about 3 years old, weighs about 20 pounds and is housebroken and hypoallergenic. We are still learning about Maggie as she settles into her foster home. Besides her fear of new people she also wants to chase cats and is scared of bikes and sudden noises. Right now, we’d recommend a home with older children over the age of 15. To meet Maggie, please fill out an adoption application!

03/19/2016	Killer Bashful - Greyhound Dog For Adoption	rescue	Greyhound	Cherry Hill, NJ	Male	"Posted Breed: Greyhound. Killer Bashful has a strange name but what a great and stunning boy!! He is calm, friendly and a ""gentle giant"". He is like an ""old soul"" with a way about him and a calmness that seems far beyond his years. He was one of our favorites--just a big ""mooshie"" boy. He was described in Florida as ""calm and a take it or leave it boy."" He walks nicely on leash. Killer Bashful will be 2 years old in May and although he loves people, no cats, please.Foster Update 3/13/2016  ""Killer""?...Well, yes, because he is DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, with big brown eyes and a soulful expression that just melts your heart. ""Bashful""?...Only in the most charming sense of the word. This big, handsome hunk is not even two years old yet. He loves to be petted and fussed over but is not needy. He is content to snooze on a dog bed in whatever room you are in. He is experiencing so many new things and is quietly curious to learn about his new life in retirement. It has been wonderful to watch him learn and grow in confidence over the three weeks he has been with us. His temperament is remarkably calm and steady, especially for such a young dog. When he does need correction, a firm “no” is usually all that is required.    He has never had an accident in the house. He mastered the stairs in a day and sleeps peacefully through the night on a dog bed in my bedroom.   He gets along well with my other greyhound, galgo and collie, both male and female. Although there are no children living in our house, he as interacted beautifully with them at two events we have attended with him.    He walks beautifully on a leash. He is, however, very interested in small animals and is not cat safe, so most likely would do best in a home with other greyhounds and/or other large dogs. As he is still a youngster, he is quite comical at times in his lack of sense of self in space, bumping into things when he forgets just how big he is.    Killer Bashful is a sweet, sensitive, gentle giant who you can’t help but to fall in love with. He will make a wonderful companion for whoever is lucky enough to adopt him.                "

She provided endless love and companionship to her previous owner, an elderly gentleman, for the last couple of years, until he could no longer care for her.  Now she is living large and enjoying all kinds of new experiences in her foster home, anxiously awaiting to find her new furever home. Although a little bit shy at first, she loves all new human friends and just adores being around other doggies.  Sally ’s new BFF is her foster brother, a 20lb mixed breed, and loves her foster sister, a 47lb dog.  Sally  has not been around cats. She is fully housebroken with a doggie door; she loves lying outside in the sun.  Sally is super excited to go on outings with her foster family – Fiesta Island is the favorite as she really loves to run, and she is fast! She keeps track of her pack and comes when called. She loves to exercise, and then rests with satisfaction afterwards!  Sally would love to be in a home with another small doggie playmate and a yard where she can relax and play outside in the sun. Sally is spayed, microchipped and up to date on her vaccines. The adoption fee to take this sweetheart home is $250. All of our dogs are in private volunteer foster homes, and as such these individuals are most qualified to answer any questions regarding the dog. We do not have a central shelter or kennel locations - you must make a private one-on-one meet and greet appointment with each individual dog at the foster family's convenience. To protect our foster families' privacy, we must have an APPROVED adoption application on file before we release their contact information.  All of our dogs are fixed (spayed/neutered) and up to date on shots. We have a 2 week foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog is a fit for your family. Adoption fees vary from dog-to-dog.  Please note that an approved application DOES NOT guarantee that the dog will be placed with you. The final decision rests with our fosters as they know the dogs the best, and please be aware that there may be other applicants interested in the same dog. We continue accepting applications on a dog until the dog is with the new adoptive family in their home.  Thank you for visiting our dogs located at www.SecondChanceDogRescue.org                "

Hello! I am Itty Bitty Shortcake! I really am itty bitty and super cute. My favorite thing to do is snuggle, cuddle, nap while cuddling, snuggle while napping and pitty-pat in anticipation of our next snuggle time! I also like to run around and see what you are up to! I am dog friendly, kid and cat safe and not food aggressive. I will do best in a home with one maybe 2 other dogs at most. I am potty-trained, crate trained and basic obedience trained.  Shortcake is a total sweetie! She was found wondering around Detroit, hungry and scared. After a few meat sticks and a hamburger, she decided it was ok to get in the car. After a day she was letting her personality come out! Shortcake loves to be loved and to love back. She can never get enough attention, pets, sticks, bones, tugs, etc. She is perfectly content running around the yard watching you, playing tug, chasing sticks (although has not mastered retrieving the sticks). For down time, give her a stick, bone, rope or chew toy and she is good to go! Her most favorite place, on your lap! Shortcake is a 3 year old small (about 34 pounds) terrier “pocket pibble” (best guess at birthday is October 2012). She is up to date on routine vaccines, spayed, parasite-free, and healthy. She does best on grain-free food. Shortcake is adorable and is looking for her forever home with lots of love, maybe your home would be just perfect.

I am really good and stay in the back seat, mostly on the floor, it is an awesome place to sleep...well except when I am sharing the seat with others, then I like to get attention and relax with a good massage.

03/19/2016	Caramelo - Labrador Retriever / Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever	Sanford, FL	Male	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Terrier (short coat). Carmelo was surrendered to Pet Rescue by Judy from a high kill shelter.  Look at that face! She is a great dog who loves to play, and is good with other dogs. She is ready to meet her new family and hopes to find a loving home.According to www.dogbreedinfo.com, the Labrador Retriever is a loving, affectionate, lovable, patient dog. Once known as the ""St John's Dogs,"" the Labrador Retriever is one of the most popular breeds in the United States. Originally from Newfoundland, Canada the Labrador was trained to jump overboard into the icy waters to haul fisherman's nets to shore. Specimens were brought to England in the 1800's by English ships coming from Labrador, where the dog's fine retrieving instincts were honed and developed. One of the best family dogs and canine companions because of their gentle, loving disposition, the highly trainable Labrador also excels in drug detection, as a guide for the blind, and service dog for the disabled. The breed is also an outstanding obedience and field trial competitor. Highly intelligent, loyal, willing, and high-spirited. Lively and good-natured, they love to play, especially in water - for they love to swim. They have an excellent, reliable, temperament and are friendly, superb with children and equable with other dogs. They crave human attention and need to feel as though they are part of the family. Labs are easily trained. These dogs are watchdogs, not guard dogs, although some have been known to guard. They have a life expectancy of 10-12 years.                "

03/19/2016	Kiki II - Beagle Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle	Tampa, FL	Female	Posted Breed: Beagle. KIKI HAS AN ADOPTION PENDINGKiki II found herself abandoned at a Florida County shelter as an owner surrender. Based on records that were turned over to us when we rescued her, she apparently comes from California. Let's hope she catches a wave of better fortune here in Florida! Kiki appears to have had some allergies that have not been handled well and now has some skin issues as a result that we shall address. We have determined that her allergies are food-related, so as long as she is on the right diet her coat is healthy and she does not itch. Kiki also has a cherry eye which we shall have our vet repair soon now that we have resolved the skin issue. She is settling into her foster home and getting along just fine with all the other dogs there. Although it is sad that her owner gave up on her, her future looks bright with Southeast Beagle Rescue.

I came to SMRS in need of a double cherry eye surgery, both of my ears were infected and I had some pesky worms. I have received my eye surgery and as you can see my eyes are so clear you can see all the way to my heart. I am now ready to find my forever home and live my life as a cherished family member. I am a super sweet boy who is crate trained, potty trained and I know how to ""sit"" on command. I do share a home with a few fur friends and get along with both. My foster home does not have a cat or children so I am not sure how I would like them. I am also a very talented cuddler and I will double as a lap warmer on those chilly nights. My daily to do list includes playing with my toys, taking short walks and keeping you company. I am a versatile boy who would be happy to live in a home with a secure fenced yard or I am low key enough to fit in perfectly into apartment life with daily outings on a leash. My special talents include my dance moves and I am quite a talker whenever you speak to me. What do you mean dogs can't talk?

03/19/2016	Harry Marion - Yorkshire Terrier Yorkie / Shih Tzu / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Shih Tzu-Unknown Mix	Pataskala, OH	Male	"Posted Breed: Yorkshire Terrier Yorkie / Shih Tzu / Mixed (medium coat). PLEASE NOTE:  If you are viewing this biography on a website other than the Ohio Fuzzy Pawz website, not all information transfers to partner websites in some instances. If you go to the individual webpage of our dogs, you will be able to get more information each dog.Harry's adoption donation is $300 and he is being fostered in Central Ohio. He has been neutered, microchipped, received his rabies, distemper/parvo, and bordetella vaccines, tested negative for heartworms and started on prevention as well as flea prevention. Harry has also had a dental cleaning. Due to his small size, we will not consider adoptors with children under the age of 8.If you are looking for a little lap dog you can snuggle with, Harry's your man!!! He is a 5 year old, 9 pound Yorkie/Shih Tzu boy who is very sweet and loves his humans, wanting to be where they are at all times. He likes to play with doggie toys, preferring his special monkey toy. He gets along great with other dogs and kitties. He is crate trained, does very well on leash, and has wonderful potty manners if kept on a schedule. When Harry came into rescue, he was hairless over the entire back half of his body due to severe flea infestation/allergies. It has taken a while to get his skin back to a normal condition to regrow his fur, so it will be important that his new family be vigilant about keeping him flea-free. He is on a grain-free food (primarily fish & sweet potato) to help promote his healthy skin and coat.  Visual breed identification in dogs can be unreliable so, in many cases, we are only guessing at the predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.   Our Adoption Process      The adoption process has several steps involved.  Please review prior to submitting an application. Our adoption process is detailed here:      http://www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/info/adoption Our volunteers work very diligently to process each application and we try to ensure that we are making the best match possible for each dog. We do not schedule meetings with dogs until an application has been approved. It can take up to a few weeks to process an application or as little time as a few days, from the time you submit an application, please be prepared to adopt as we cannot hold dogs. Special Requirements Some dogs may have special requirements (for example, medications, a fence) -- if you apply for a dog, please be sure to read over the biography completely to see if there are any special needs and if you're home would be suitable. If we indicate on the dog's biography that a fence is required, this means your home must have a physical fence. Other dogs may require a ""strong vet reference"" which indicates that we are looking for a home that has a documented history of veterinary care with previous pets.  The first step in our process is to submit an online adoption application at www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/forms. The application MUST include the personal references and veterinary, grooming, and landlord references (if applicable) and their respective contact information. If you do not include the references and the contact information, your application will be delayed as it CANNOT be processed. Once the references have been successfully completed, a home visit is then scheduled when a rescue representative can meet all members of the family or residents of the home. No application is approved prior to the home visit being done.  At that point, the Directors will discuss any and all applications on a foster dog and make a selection--in many cases, there are multiple applications for each dog, so please be understanding that our only priority is the successful placement of each of our foster dogs. Out of State Adoptions We do adopt out of state to outstanding applicants, however, our process requires a home visit, so out of state adoptions can take longer. We do not ship our dogs, adopters should be prepared to pick up the dog in Central Ohio.                "

He is a hair dog so needs a life time grooming commitment. He's looking for an active, fun family that will work on training and provide a lot of adventures. He's way behind the learning curve and still a bit mouthy so requires a firm but fair owner that will appropriately train and teach him what he needs to know to be a good adult. No younger kids due to his mouthy ways. If you're looking for a docile, chilled out shih Tzu, he's probably not the right guy for you. He needs an active family.  Our home page has information about our rescue, adoption process and link to our adoption application www.collarofhope.org We are a foster home based rescue and have no facility to visit. Prior to adoption, our dogs are spay/neutered, vaccinated including rabies/age appropriate, and parasite treated/prevented as a minimum. Adoption fee is $300 Click on bone to complete an application.

03/19/2016	Mylo - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	San Francisco, CA	Male	"Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Mylo here has amazing story that he wants to share with you. This poor guy was roaming around the IKEA parking lot looking uncared for and with a tight harness on that was cutting into his underarms and chest. Luckily for Mylo, a good samaritan noticed him and decided to help this lonely dog in need, get him the vet attention he needed, and allow him the opportunity of having a second chance at a real, loving home. Since Mylo's rescue his foster mom has noticed how sweet this boy is. He immediately warmed up to her and her husband while showing them how much of a good walker he is, several tricks he can perform when asked, and how loving he can be to the right caring family.   Here is what Mylo's foster mom says----      "" I can't say enough GOOD things about this dog! He's definitely a lover, but he's not a lap dog and he hasn't tried to jump on any of our furniture. He's INCREDIBLY polite. As soon as we tell him ""no"" he stops and backs away. He loves to bounce around the yard after a walk, but as soon as we tell him 'all done!' he immediately calms down. He and my dog have been getting along amazingly - right now they sniff each other a little bit, but pretty much just ignore each other (my dog is 11 so he's kind of over playing with other dogs). He's a GREAT walker, he doesn't pull or try to chase anything. He sits, shakes, and lays down on command and will release a ball or a toy as well without any problems. And he loooooooooves playing fetch with a tennis ball or just carrying one around in his mouth. He does great in the backseat of my car when I had to drive him around. He also has slept through the night every night for the past two weeks and doesn't wake us up (we keep him in our room and he sleeps on a dog bed on the floor). He hasn't shown any aggression towards either of us, including when I found him. He definitely loves being around people and is not a street dog! We've also been able to give him a few baths and he takes them like a champ!      My husband and I have fostered dogs before when we lived in LA a few years ago and he is by far the most well mannered one we've ever had. "" If you would like to give this boy the home he truly deserves please fill out an adoption application on our website www.ilovefamilydog.org.                "

03/19/2016	SNOW of Cincinnati, OH - American Eskimo Dog Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Eskimo Dog	Randallstown, MD	Female	Posted Breed: American Eskimo Dog. Please Note: This animal is listed as a courtesy to another organization or individual. Please be sure to contact the foster/caretaker for more information about him/her SNOWBALL or SNOW     She is one strong and determined little 23 lbs of American Eskimo.  She is about 4 yrs old, spayed female, has all her shots, and is in very good health.  She is crate & house trained, and will lay on the floor next to you and chew on a bone, or she will engage and round and play with the other dogs.  She is slightly stand-offish at first, but look out once she warms up to you. She will do her prancing dance for you then jump into your lap to give kisses. Snow was surrendered to Ohio American Eskimo Rescue Community last  year in 2015.  We would prefer a fenced in yard due to her urge to take off and run.   She likes all dogs, big, small, young, or old. She thinks cats want to play with her, so she will chase them. She would be a great family dog.  If interested please email us at OhioEskieRescue@outlook.com  She is up for adoption with Ohio American Eskimo Community. Please contact Anne Golias via FaceBook, or phone: 216-272-8696 or email: amgolias@hotmail.com.  This is a courtesy post, please use the contact information provided.                
03/19/2016	Jack - German Shepherd Dog Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Baltimore, MD	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog. PLEASE NOTE: This animal is listed as a courtesy for another organization. This dog is not with All Shepherd Rescue. Do not fill out an application online, instead please be sure to contact the foster/caretaker listed below for more information.    Located in VA.   Jack is 7 years old, lives in Virginia, is house-trained, neutered and current on his vaccinations. He has separation anxiety and he is very attached to his Active Duty dad. So much so that his caregivers when Dad is away have a difficult time making him happy and comfortable. The change in routine is very problematic for Jack and he spends most of his time shaking on his bed and licking his paws.    Jack will need to be an only pet in a home with preferably one person with which he can bond. He knows some basic obedience, likes to go for walks and car rides. His favorite pastimes are watching TV and chewing his bone. He is very loyal and is a very calm dog when his human is around. Jack has never been around children or cats.    Please contact Jack's family if you are interested in learning more about him and possibly offering him a home where he does not have to move every couple of years.

Adopting A Shelter Dog These dogs come without background histories/ past medical information. We present these dogs as we have observed in relationship to age, size, breed, behavior, housebreaking, crate training, good with children, cats, dogs, and strangers. Dogs may present themselves differently in different environments, therefore The Dog Spot Rescue, their agents, volunteers, can not guarantee behavior, age, size expectations, breed, house Training, destructive behavior tendencies, and/or medical issues. All dogs from shelters have been subjected to pathogens from the shelter level which can materialize into disease in the future. Each adopter must observe for themselves pre-adoption and make decisions for themselves the suitability of said dog and their tolerance levels for transitional time when adopting a shelter dog. We ask that each adopter take their time when making the choice to bring home a rescued dog. Paco- Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix, red, 2 years old. Under 10 pounds, adoring, well behaved, LOVES to be held and cuddled. Will sit for hours with you. Great with the kids, strangers.

Any dog that shows symptoms here at TDS are routinely identified, taken for tests and treatment. Our vet bills can exceed $10,000 a month. However, without symptoms, we may miss a disease, or pre-existing condition or parasite. Consider carefully if you have the tolerance for these possibilities.

I am good with dogs, been exposed to cats but not lived with, and have been around horses. OPAL'S STORY: Meet Opal! Opal was pulled from the local CA kill shelter on her final day. Opal is very stoic and regal in her presence and seems to take things in stride. She has a very sweet personality but doesn't need to be in your lap to be happy.  She would do best in a situation that would allow her to have a job, the job could be as simple as doing her obedience or as something to keep her really busy, like a working farm dog. She would very much enjoy another playful dog, she loves to play! She will require a firm but fair leader to be the confident pack working pup she has become.  Opal is currently with a professional trainer and has come out of her shell! She will come with private training for the new adoptive owners or fosters as well as continued support. Opal knows basic obedience, is kennel trained, potty trained, off leash trained, just to list a few of her wonderful qualities.  Would be ok with older children that understand the rules and boundaries.  Fee includes spay, current vaccinations, and her microchip.

03/19/2016	Thunder - Rottweiler (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler	Hillsboro, NH	Female	"Posted Breed: Rottweiler (medium coat). Esthetically, Thunder is a beautiful representative of the Rottweilers breed. He is a masterpiece and a head turner. He has been remarkably well fed and well cared for. Thunder has been a few days with us and he has been quite well behaved and friendly to whoever handled him. His former owner had him since he was a puppy, but surrendered him to an urban shelter because he was not good with the small dog of the house. He is socially acceptable with adults, an older child and large dogs. Thunder is welcoming in his kennel and leashed easily. He was not walked in the street but in the yard and strolled majestically, heeling perfectly and was happy to get treats from an admiring crowd. He sat on command very peacefully and accepted politely many treats. .He got his chance at playgroup and enjoyed the games for a while. Thunder is about 15 months old, altered, and is looking for continued training for his adolescent mind.  3/17/16 update: I met Thunder this week and despite his description from the shelter, he takes time to warm up to people. He is not aggressive about it, but he is fearful. It took him half of a big of treats to decide I was his friend and could pat him. After that, we were best buddies.

03/19/2016	FOSTERS NEEDED - American Eskimo Dog Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Eskimo Dog	Randallstown, MD	Female	"Posted Breed: American Eskimo Dog. ***FOSTER HOMES NEEDED******Click here for >> Foster Application***Eskie Rescuers United rescues stray, orphaned, unwanted or abused Eskies from humane societies, pounds, shelters, or from owners who need to find a new home for their Eskies. We are ALWAYS in need of foster homes for these dogs until they can be adopted. It's vacation season and people are leaving town- and dumping their dogs!! We're desperate for foster homes-- help!! The primary role of the foster home is to evaluate the new Eskie as to health, behavior and temperament, as follows:HEALTHDetermine what medical needs the Eskie has, such as routine vaccinations, heartworm tests (and heartworm treatment, if necessary), being spayed/neutered, having their teeth cleaned, etc. In the case of our more severely abused or neglected dogs, the foster home ensures that the dog gets the medical attention required to get him/her back to optimal health. BEHAVIOR AND TEMPERAMENT1. Evaluate the dog for behavioral issues and work to correct any undesirable traits exhibited by the dog. These may include not being housebroken, needing basic obedience training (including learning to walk on a leash), excessive barking, etc. 2. Evaluate the dog's temperament: is he/she friendly, aggressive, shy, scared, submissive? How does the dog get along with other dogs, cats, children, men, women, strangers, and so on? The foster home will then be responsible for providing the proper training and socialization needed to make the dog adoptable.After the assessment and vetting of the dog, the foster home provides ERU with bio information and pictures, so the dog can be posted on ERU's website and on Petfinder.com. Sometimes our foster homes also participate in adoption events that provide additional exposure both to the foster dog and to Eskie Rescuers United.ERU pays for the cost of all vetting and medical needs of our foster dogs, including heartworm and flea/tick medications. The foster home provides for the dog's food, treats and toys and is not reimbursed for those expenses by ERU. Fostering a rescue dog can be a lot of work and responsibility. Some of these dogs were never provided proper socialization or medical care, and therefore are not perfectly behaved or impeccably groomed. MANY of our fosters come from deplorable situations and may need a lot of tender loving care to get them cleaned up, be taught how to trust again, or just simply realize what it's like to be loved and cherished! Before applying to become a new foster home, please ask yourself (and your family members) if you have enough time and patience, as well as the understanding of the Eskie breed, to care properly for a rescue dog. Fostering can be an incredibly rewarding labor of love, and you can make all the difference in the world to the dog(s) you foster. If you are interested in fostering an Eskie, please go to: our website, www.eskierescuers.org and sign-in and complete a foster application. Thank you for your interest in wanting to help care for these beautiful white dogs!""Saving just one dog won't change the world... ...but surely, the world will change for that one dog!"" Whenever possible Eskie Rescuers United tries to adopt out its dogs locally (or at least to adopters in adjoining states to where I'm being fostered). Please note that ERU processes LOCAL adoption applications before considering those from out of state. If I'm not local to you, as explained above, and you really have your heart set on me, you will have to make special arrangements so ERU can get me to you safely (for example, flying me to you at your own expense, or paying a transport group to drive me to you). Note: We may ask that you to make a donation to cover transport costs if the distance is great and we have trouble finding transport drivers.There is an adoption fee required; and, please be aware, Eskie Rescuers United will not adopt out its dogs as outdoor dogs.    Eskie Rescuers United American Eskimo Dog Rescue, Inc. is an IRS-approved 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Please click the donation button below to make a tax-deductible donation through PayPal and help make a difference to even one American Eskimo dog!                "

Originally a stray in South Carolina, Seth has been living in our home for the past year and a half. He is a very sweet and loving boy who will greet you with a big smile while he wiggles and sings you a song. He gets along great with our cat and he loves all people he meets including young kids and babies. We live in an apartment building and Seth is not a barker so he does not disturb the neighbors’ peace. Seth enjoys going on walks and runs. He needs a moderate amount of exercise and would do well in a home with a fenced in yard for him to run free. Seth is particular about his dog friends and is reactive to stranger dogs, but once properly introduced to a certain type of dog he will make a friend for life. Seth is a fast learner and excelled in dog class.

03/19/2016	Zoey - Rottweiler (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler	Hillsboro, NH	Female	"Posted Breed: Rottweiler (medium coat). Zoey is an absolute love. She was surrendered to a Maryland shelter by her owner because he lost his job and could no longer care for her. She is reportedly good with kids and other dogs but not with cats. Her former owner also reported that she is house trained, knows basic commands, loves to play fetch and likes going for car rides.  After 2 days at at the shelter, Zoey began to vomit fabric. An abdominal exploration was performed and a shredded towel was removed from her stomach and intestines.  Following surgery, Zoey was fed a bland GI diet and treated with sucralafate, metronidazole, and probiotics. Her appetite is back and she has normal defecation and urination. She wants nothing more than to lay across your lap and smother you in kisses. ​ Please visit our web site at <a href=""http://www.4theloveofdog.org/adopt.html"">http://www.4theloveofdog.org</a> for all adoption information.

COURTESY LISTINGTHIS IS NOT A BULLY PAWS DOG. COURTESY LISTINGS ARE LISTED BY THEIR CURRENT OWNERS OR RESCUERS AND HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY BULLY PAWS.IF THIS DOG IS CURRENTLY IN A RESCUE OR FOSTER HOME, YOU WILL SEE THE CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW. IF THERE IS NO CONTACT INFORMATION LISTED, PLEASE CONTACT OUR REHOMING COORDINATOR AT STEPHANIE@BULLYPAWS.ORG.  CHARLIE NEEDS A FOSTER OR ADOPTER BEFORE MARCH 20TH 2016 We have had her for just over 2 years and adopted her from the PWC animal shelter. She will be 3 years old in August. She is very energetic, loves to play and be around her people. When we first adopted her, we had her in training classes and she was doing very well. She knows and obeys basic commands such as sit, lay down, paw and come. Shortly after we adopted her we discovered we were having a baby and we just did not have the time to devote to sticking with it. I believe if someone could devote the time, she could be amazingly trained.   She does have a few issues, but nothing insurmountable with more training and patience. First and foremost, as stated above, she needs to be an only dog. She is calm when we are home, but when visitors come, she does tend to bark and jump. Never in an attacking way, more in an “I’m really excited and want to play with you” way. I have never seen her be aggressive towards people, However she can be unsure around certain rambunctious children. But, that being said, she has been amazing with my 16 month old since he was a newborn. She will chew on things, but if plenty of heavy duty nylabones are around, she should be fine. She does need to be crated when you leave the house. We have a crate and a ton of toys that can be given with her. She loves to sleep in bed with her people at night.   She is up to date on her shots and Spayed. She is microchipped.

I feel extremely happy and energetic when I go out for walks. I’m always grateful to be around people so much that I make sure to give out hugs to everyone I'm around. Being around humans makes me incredibly happy; it’ll bring my silly side out. I can get a little rambunctious but people seem to enjoy seeing how goofy I can be. You should experience this excitement in person by visiting me. Just be prepared for my paws to go for a hug, but I’m sure I'll immediately win you over that you'll be happy to hug me back.

Please contact Paula (pjstoppler@msn.com) for more information about this pet.Hi! My name is Boomer. I'm a 1 year old neutered male Bull Terrier. I was adopted by a family about 5 months ago and, bless their hearts, knew nothing about my breed. I am amazing with my 3 and 5 year old human kids and my 2 big dog buddies but unfortunately LOVE to chase and kill cats and chickens. I know basic commands (I am a little ""bull headed"" however ha!), great on a leash, love rides in the car, will snuggle for hours in your lap, and potty trained. If you aren't the farm type with ""rodents"" to chase and spend a lot of time doing something that I can do with you, I'm your man! I probably should join a doggie class to work on my socialization skills. I live in the country and don't get out much, you see. I dont think I'm quite ready to take a trip to Petco and meet a Chihuahua. My mom says they look similar to a cat so... I'd most likely do best being an only pet. I lovefamily and they love me so SO much, but I know there's someone out there that wants to love me just as much (maybe even more since I wont be killing all of the animals on the farm).

03/19/2016	Lincoln - Beagle Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle	Nashville, TN	Male	"Posted Breed: Beagle. Lincoln has so much love to give! He is full of energy and loves to run and play. Since the weather has been nice, he has been enjoying our fenced back yard during the day. He is not house broken and he doesn't have a clue what to do with the pee pads so he sleeps in his crate at night when we can't watch for signs that he needs to go potty, during the day when he is inside we let him out frequently and that seems to have kept the potty accidents to a minimum, so I think he is learning.      He loves to play tug of war with people and with other dogs (he crouches down to play with little Shadow, it's the cutest thing!) Tator is afraid of him and runs and hides and Mickey is just an old man who likes to sleep a lot, so Lincoln plays mostly with Shadow and Bridget. He seems to be submissive, he does not try to show dominance. He likes to counter surf and we are working on that, he responds well to ""no""     He will make a great companion to someone who has the time to give him, he is a very busy boy, very playful, very loving, high energy, submissive, he may be too much for children under five though because he does like to jump, Bridget will be 8 next month and she is fine with him, but I would not recommend him with very small children.      He will definitely need a fenced yard, he really needs the opportunity to run and play.                "

03/19/2016	Primrose - Podengo Portugueso / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Nashville, TN	Female	"Posted Breed: Podengo Portugueso / Mixed. Primrose came to us through animal control in West Tennessee. She was surrendered by some people who said they found her near a restaurant covered in grease, and oil. They stated that they knew they couldn't keep her, but they took her home, bathed her, and cleaned her up prior to surrender.‎ Primrose, ""Prim"", as she prefers to be called, was frightened, timid, and shy. Upon arrival she was terribly afraid. Each day, she was worked with, talked to, and spoiled. Slowly she began to come to life, and that was how she got her name. Primroses can bloom later, and longer in the season than most flowers. She was delicate, gentle, trusting but only just... her face displayed such yearning, and an almost desperate want to believe that there was goodness in people. As days passed she began to smile, and venture around her environment. While she was curious, she also maintained a timid stature. Watching her, it felt almost as if one was encountering goodness, pureness, innocence... she was easy to adore, and had been overlooked by so many... she is simply precious, in every way... she's hopeful, and we all need a little hope. She has faith, and probably shouldn't by now, but that's what faith is-- the belief that goodness shall come to those who wait. When I look at her, I see grace, and love. She's awesome, I can't say enough about her. Prim likes most dogs and really comes out of her shell when she plays. Will do well in a home with other dogs. She loves to snuggle on the couch. Loves treats and playing with a tennis ball or other toys! Would generally rather be in the house than outside and alternately does ok on walks and then sits down and doesn't want to move! I so understand that!! Prim is was deprived a childhood of sorts and still has some puppy behavior so we recommend frozen carrots and kongs with peanut butter to occupy her while you are gone. We would love it if we could find a family that had someone at home during the day. But a better friend you'll never find. We are in search of exceptional above exceptional family for this precious late bloomer.                "

03/19/2016	Haggar (Behavior Hold) - English Bulldog / English Bulldog (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Bulldog	Phoenix, AZ	Male	Posted Breed: English Bulldog / English Bulldog (short coat). Meet Haggar, a handsome English Bulldog just under 2 years old. Haggar is currently on a behavioral hold until we find the perfect family that will be able to continue with the training that he has received while in the care of Almost Home Bulldog Rescue. Haggar came to us needing to learn that nothing in life is free! He was in dire need of extensive behavioral training to learn that you cannot act out when you don’t get what you want. Now doesn’t he just sound like a typical toddler :) Since first coming into rescue his progress has been nothing short of AMAZING! When Haggar arrived he was not able to interact with any of us as he would act out in aggression. Leaving us to fear that he would not be able to be placed. Almost Home decided to accept the challenge and give this young boy a shot at happiness. Haggar underwent extensive behavioral rehabilitation at Top Dog Training where he has learned to trust and interact with people. He has learned 5 basic commands that are the staple of his daily life… sit, down, break, ehh and no. More importantly he knows that his handler is in control and making all the decisions for him which is exactly what he needs.   PLEASE NOTE: With some dogs this is a learned behavior that can be modified with training however Haggar will always need this structure in his life to be successful. Haggar now knows that we were here to help him and welcomes a booty scratch or a belly rub. His body language has shifted and he is no longer anxious and angry. Instead he is happy and calm. It was just too much for him to be making all the decisions. New situations are a bit stressful for him and he looks to his handler for direction and to know he is ok. He does give clear warning signs when he is looking to test the limits so a new mom or dad for him will be able to see this as well. We know that he will need a special home and a family that is open to providing the structure he needs to be a calm, happy bully. Haggar will also need to be in a quiet home that has no children and no other dogs.  We know his forever family is out there and will see all the amazing qualities of this special boy that we do.

03/19/2016	Seren(dipity) - Hound / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Nashville, TN	Female	Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed. Meet Serendipity (or Seren)!!  Seren was found in a laundromat in a motel in Dickson by a great couple that tended to her inital vetting and brought her to Proverbs when they were leaving the area.  Seren is the happiest, sweetest puppy ever however does have neurological issues either from birth or disease as a young pup. Don't bother telling her she has issues - she doesn't want to know. Yes, her gait is wobbly but has improved somewhat and hopefully will improve a bit as she grow and becomes aware of her forever home. No, after consulting with our vet there is no medical intervention indicated - just someone to love and care for her as she is.  She loves to run and play (even tho it can result in falls and/or somersaults - she just gets up and goes again). She has learned to go up and down a few steps but a home with a lot of stairs is not recommended. Seren loves other dogs and her ideal home would include at least one other playful dog, a fenced yard and no stairs. Oh - she is pretty much house trained but does not like being crated. She generally responds to Seren, but likes it when you call her Serendipity with a bit of a lilt on the diptiy part.

Minimum Adoption Donation is $350 (includes deworming, microchip with free registration, age appropriate vaccinations, spay/neuter if performed by our vet, 30 days of health insurance).

However, it is required by law for all dogs adopted from IL rescues and shelters to be altered within 30 days of adoption. We must have proof that it is performed in the 30 days. Adopters may use their own vet at their own cost as long as proof of the surgery is provided in 30 days.  If adopting a puppy and you have adult dogs who go to public places, such as dog parks, they can be tracking home virus' to your puppy. Not only should the puppy be kept home from dog parks, pet stores, and such until he/she completes the puppy vaccination series at 4 months of age, but so should the adult dogs in the household. Please do not adopt a puppy if you cannot protect him/her from exposure to virus' as his/her immune system develops.  Please remember that puppies require a midday meal, frequent potty breaks, and plenty of playtime for the first several months. Make arrangements if needed to have someone visit midday, every day, if no one will be home.

03/19/2016	Daphne - Corgi / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Pembroke Welsh Corgi-Unknown Mix	Sanford, FL	Female	"Posted Breed: Corgi / Mixed (short coat). Daphne is a Welsh Corgi blend.  She is a little shy at first but once she warms up to you she will love you forever. Daphne is timid around men, loves women and is good with other dogs (we can cat test if needed). As for being housetrained, she will not go to the bathroom in her crate unless she has to go really bad and no one is around to let her out at that moment.  She is really a sweet girl who would love a home!According to www.dogbreedinfo.com, the Cardigan and the Pembroke Welsh Corgis have been considered separate breeds for only about 70 years (Cardigans have a long tail; Pembrokes don't have a tail). There are several theories about the origins of the Welsh Corgi. Both Corgis varieties may be descended form Swedish Vallhunds brought to Wales by Vikings in the 800's. Or perhaps the Cardigan is the older variety, brought to Wales by the Celts in about 1200 BC. The name ""Corgi"" comes from the Celtic word for dog. The breed was mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086). The Corgi drove cattle by barking and nipping at the cattle's heals. His low stature helped him role out of the way when a cow kicked. Corgis still maintain that habit when chasing each other. Corgi is highly intelligent, obedient, protective and robust. Steady, loyal and loving, but wary of strangers. They are willing to please. Several of these brave dogs have lost their lives defending their homes, as they were too small for the situation. A Pembroke Welsh Corgi is well-known as the favorite breed and pet of Queen Elizabeth II. Because of royal favor, and perhaps because of a slightly gentler personality, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has become very popular, while the Cardigan is not as widespread. They have a life-expectancy of 12-15 years.                "

Starla loves snuggles on the couch, doting on her humans, playing with toys, gentle ear rubs, belly rubs and cuddling in bed if you like!  :-)  She gets along fine with the resident dogs but doesn’t necessarily need them to keep her company either. She loves visitors—no yipping here, just a lot of tail wagging waiting to be noticed. Starla is free to roam the house unless we are gone more than four hours. Then we put her in her doggy suite (small office room) with a pee pad just in case, which she uses well when needed. Don’t hesitate to put in your app. Her pictures do not do justice in showing how beautiful and wonderful she really is.      All dogs are in individual foster homes throughout the Twin Cities.

Panda is a seven week old Corgi-Dachshund Puppy raised by a foster mom chihuahua here at the rescue. We have his real Mom- Lucy lou. Lucy was dropped into a box, in labor in the middle of the nite and left in front of the shelter. She gave birth two 2 puppies. One died of exposure. Panda crawled into the blankets and went unnoticed for 24 hours by shelter staff. He lived and managed to eek out enough milk to survive but not thrive. When Lucy Lou and Panda arrived at the rescue, I placed him with our nursing Chihuahua where he has thrived and even out grew his foster sibs. Panda is a very sweet, loving, playful little guy. His mom weighs only 8 lbs, so even if dad was a purbred corgi, he will never weigh more than 25-30lbs,  Panda is totally a lap dog. He thrives on attention. Panda loves other dogs and tries to make friends with everyone he meets. He has not met a cat yet, but we believe he will try to be the cat's best friend if there is one in the home. Panda is curious, smart, friendly and very cute. he would be apartment/Condo appropriate if given enough excercise, would make a great RV travel pup and a great addition to any pack

To protect our foster families' privacy, we must have an APPROVED adoption application on file before we release their contact information.

Please note that an approved application DOES NOT guarantee that the dog will be placed with you. The final decision rests with our fosters as they know the dogs the best, and please be aware that there may be other applicants interested in the same dog. We continue accepting applications on a dog until the dog is with the new adoptive family in their home.  Thank you for visiting our dogs located at www.SecondChanceDogRescue.org                "

Although it takes me some time to get use to other dogs I love to snuggle and enjoy my time with my people! I also love all of my toys! I am house broken and crate trained. I would love to find my forever home with someone who can spoil me but also maintain structure in the home. I came to the rescue with my brother Petey who is also looking for his forever home. I have a big personality and would love to have someone guide me into new adventures and learning experiences with them could that be you?

03/19/2016	Petey - Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Jack Russell Terrier-Unknown Mix	Tonawanda, NY	Male	Posted Breed: Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (medium coat). Pleased to meet you! I am Petey! I am about 5 yrs old and am a Jack Russel Terrier Mix. I came to Buffalo CARES with my sister Polly when, sadly, my previous owner passed away. As you can tell by my pictures, I am an active little dude just like most JRTs. (Can you tell by my pictures – I am always on the move!) I love to run around the yard, going for walks, and chasing toys and balls. Don't worry though - I also love a great nap. I also like to hang out in the house, and browse out the windows to see who is doing what out there. My foster mom says sometimes I act more like a cat because I like to lay on the back of the couch and watch the world go by. I am housebroken and do pretty well in my crate but can get a little whiny, (but that’s because I’d prefer to be out with the folks or to be sleep in the bed!). I get along well with my canine and feline foster siblings. Prior to Buffalo CARES, I grew up in a home without kids and prefer the adult company right now. I do OK with those young ones, except they can get me a little riled up so I would do best with in a household that has children over 8 years old that can understand I sometimes need my space. I am looking for a new family to love me – will that be you? Petey's adoption fee is $225.All dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered.

03/19/2016	LOUIE - Poodle (Miniature) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Poodle (Miniature)	Pasadena, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Poodle (Miniature). United Hope for Animals (UHA) is a volunteer group and does not have a facility for animals. This pet is part of our Shelter Support Program at the Baldwin Park Shelter. For more information about the pet, the adoption process, or our program please contact the Volunteer Adoption Coordinator listed below. Because animals are adopted/rescued daily, please also check the United Hope for Animals Facebook page to see if an animal is still available OR call the Baldwin Park Shelter at 626-962-3577. When inquiring about an animal, please reference the animal’s ID number. This will enable the volunteer or Baldwin Park employee to locate the status of the pet. Thank you for supporting rescue. Pet Information CONTACT: UHA ADOPTION COORDINATOR KRISTIN AT 626-393-6258 OR AT kristin@hope4animals.org Description:   ID# A4925730 Louie is a charming and dignified 8-year-old apricot male Miniature Poodle whose owner abandoned him at the Baldwin Park Animal Care Center (no reason provided) on March 6th. Weighing 19 lbs, Louie has a waggly tail that tells everyone a nice hello, even as he’s showing off his good leash skills. He greets other dogs with ease, and just seems to take everything in stride, including the alopecia he has on his under-neck and chest. The shelter vet also noted dental calculus and did not make a final diagnosis on the cause of the alopecia, although Louie has been on antibiotics. Louie was obviously someone’s pet but was not taken care of well, but that hasn’t dampened his spirits. We think this guy with the bright outlook and genial manner will be a loving indoor pet and companion for an individual or family who’s looking for an easygoing and easy-to-love sweetheart.

You may call 919-772-2326 to speak to a counselor for more information prior to your visit. The SPCA has an adoption counseling process for adopters to learn adoption guidelines and adoption options. There are lots of amazing words that start with the letter ''T'' - Terrific! Tremendous! And Terry! Ha! It''s true, I am the handsome guy in need of a loving home. Now when we first meet, I will probably sniff around before I come up and say hello. I don''t mean to come across as rude; I''m just a true hound and love-love-love new smells! Which means walks would be a great bonding experience for us. Nothing feels better than that morning breeze flowing through my fur or the afternoon breeze or the evening breeze! We can walk all day everyday if you ask me! I find small animals way too interesting for my own good, so I will need a home without kitties and small dogs.  I would be thrilled to be your one and only as it means I get all your attention to myself (I am selective about dog friends). I really love to play tug, so toys would be great! Oh - and tennis balls! I do love to fetch! I''ll even drop the ball and sit for you to throw it again. Wow - I''m really quite a catch! I weigh ~71 lbs. and am full grown.~My adoption fee is $95.00.~Many adoptions will take approximately 1 hour or more. Adoption requirements and tips to speed up the adoption process:  Please be able to provide a valid photo I.D. with your current address (If your I.D. does not reflect your current address, bring a piece of mail with your name and address on it) Be able to prove that you are allowed to have a pet where you live (proof of home ownership or a copy of your rental lease including the specific pet policy) Bring along all members of your household, including dogs for an introduction to a new dog. However, we do recommend meeting with an adoption counselor before involving children in the pet selection process. To avoid longer wait times, we strongly recommended that dog-to-dog meetings take place after 1:00pm.  Participate in adoption counseling process to learn adoption guidelines and adoption options. Adoption Fees: Dogs & Puppies: $115.00 Cats & Kittens: $95.00 Rabbits: $50.00 Adoption fees include: Basic wellness exam, first vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, deworming and flea preventative.

Please contact Dawn (muttsncats@verizon.net) for more information about this pet.3/9/2016 Baye is having surgery on 17 March and will be available for adoption after she is medically cleared.   Baye is 12 years old and had lived with a family and two small dogs for 8 years. Her owner passed away and Baye and her canine pals were moved outdoors. We do not know how long she lived outside. A local organization was contacted and they offered to take Baye and the other dogs to the vet. When they called from the vet’s office, the owner said to not bring the dogs back. Due to Baye’s age and condition; overweight, skin infections, and large tumors there was concern Baye may be a hospice dog. The shelter does not have the resources to provide that type of care and contacted VGSR. Baye was brought in under urgent circumstances.  Initial testing of the tumors indicates they are benign. Baye will undergo surgery to have them removed and biopsied. Baye does have a secondary skin infection and an ear infection. Both are being treated. Despite all of this Baye is a bundle of wiggles and smiles. She is incredibly sweet and gentle. Baye has adjusted very well to the new chapter of her life and gets along nicely with the resident dogs. Her energy level is impressive for being 12 years old. Baye rides beautifully in the car, is good on leash, wiggles when she walks and enjoys moseying the yard and smelling everything she can put her nose upon! Baye is rather irresistible when she walks up to you and calmly stands gazing at you with an ever so slight sway of her tail. When you cave and make eye contact, the tail wags a little faster and she smiles. No way can you resist her charms! Baye will be attending adoption events throughout Virginia. Approved adopters may contact her foster: muttsncats@verizon.net If you would like to sponsor Baye or contribute to her surgery, please click the link ‘Sponsor this Pet’ under her picture.

Check out his Facebook page (please ""Like"" us while you are there): http://tinyurl.com/hj7dl5r     Disclosure:    Breed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog’s DNA determines appearance!  Passion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as “dog friendly” and “child friendly” should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.                "

When inquiring about an animal, please reference the animal’s ID number. This will enable the volunteer or Baldwin Park employee to locate the status of the pet. Thank you for supporting rescue. Pet Information CONTACT: UHA ADOPTION COORDINATOR KRISTIN AT 626-393-6258 OR AT kristin@hope4animals.org Description: A3442642 Max is an agreeable and gentle 9-year-old black-and-brown neutered male German Shepherd mix who came to the Baldwin Park Animal Care Center on February 28th as an owner surrender (no reason given). Weighing 100 lbs, and needing to lose a few of them, Max is a kind and easygoing family-man type of dog, one who’d be great with kids and happy just being part of the family circle. Even at 100 lbs, Max is easy to handle, manageable (his handler was a small woman, and she had no problems with him—if he pulled one way, she’d pull a bit in the direction she wanted, and he’d give up easily!). Max has fly strike damage to his ear tips, a sign that he was probably left outside a lot, but he’s jovial and a tail-wagger, ready to get out of his kennel, meet other dogs (he gets along fine with them all), and get brushed and petted. We think he’ll be perfect as an inside pet and ready-made “big old family dog” for any individual or family, especially one who’ll give him good care, including an exercise and diet routine that gets him back in shape.

I am called that because I was born on Halloween 11 years ago. My foster mom calls me Spookie-Wookie because I'm such a goof. A loveable goof! But I've had kinda tough ending to my family life as I knew it. Due to a divorce and not proper care, I was left outside alot and my fur became a real mess. So, after I was rescued, my foster mom took me to the groomer and I had a lot of my fur chopped off. But my fur has grown out soft and long. I love attention and to be petted. I am very gentle when taking treats, too. I am cautious to strangers, like a lot of eskies, but will warm up to them pretty quick if you let me do it on my own term. I really would like a quiet household without a lot of traffic and a nice fenced in yard as that is what I'm used to. I don't jump on furniture and I listen very well. I am crate trained, too! I'm a pretty low maintenance guy just wanting to be loved. But I'm not a lap dog, either. I get real panicky if picked up and definately do not want to sit on anyone's lap.

03/19/2016	Mia D151602 - Rottweiler (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler	Eden Prairie, MN	Female	Posted Breed: Rottweiler (short coat). Name: Mia Age: 8 years  Gender: Female Breed: Rottweiler Weight: 90 lbs Dog friendly: Yes Cat friendly: Yes Kid friendly: Yes House trained: Yes Crate trained: Yes Energy level: Low History:  Adoption Fee: $250      From The Foster:     Meet Miss Mia!! Everywhere Mia goes, people gush about how sweet she is! There's nothing Mia loves more than a scratch on the head from a friend. She also loves snuggling with stuffed animals and chewing on her bones and balls. Mia is an incredibly low energy dog. If she had her way, she would be content to lay around 24 hours a day. She will need to have a little exercise routine though, as she is sadly out of shape. Just a short walk each day! Mia enjoys meandering around, sniffing every little blade of grass, so she will need someone willing to work on keeping her going. Because of her low energy level, Mia doesn't enjoy having hyper dogs jump all over her, and is a dominant female. She does great with her pitbull foster sister though! Mia likes other dogs, ignores cats, and has lived with children. She sleeps in her crate by choice, and is fine in there during the day. She is completely house trained, and will scratch at the door to go out. But she gosh darn well expects a treat when she comes back in!! Mia is very good motivated, and has learned that she needs to sit and take treats gently. If left unsupervised without anything appropriate to chew on, Mia will help herself to whatever she can get her paws on, but prefers her own chewies. Nylabones, raw bones, ropes, bully sticks, hooves, Greenies, tennis balls, plastic balls, rubber balls, this girl is not picky!!! And she absolutely requires some nice big stuffed animals to snuggle with (which she will very occasionally decide to destroy!) Mia is a typical Rottweiler- lovable, sweet, stubborn and not the brightest bulb on the tree! Please fill out an application to meet Mia today!!     All dogs are in individual foster homes throughout the Twin Cities.  FILL OUT AN APPLICATION TODAY!

03/19/2016	Sirius - Black Labrador Retriever (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Hewitt, NJ	Male	Posted Breed: Black Labrador Retriever (short coat). www.TheLastResortRescue.com PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET THE FIRST STEP IS TO FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION AVAILABLE AT THELASTRESORTRESCUE.COM. WE CANNOT RESPOND TO GENERAL INQUIRES ABOUT A DOG WITHOUT AN APPLICATION ON FILE.   This perfect gentleman is Sirius. Sirius is an 8 year old black Labrador Retriever. We saved Sirius from a high kill shelter in a rural part of Georgia. Sirius came in a stray so we’re not sure of his history, but we’re not sure why no one came looking for him! He’s near perfect. Sirius is a total love and a complete gentleman. He loves going for walks and is good on a leash. He has your classic Lab personality – he’s laid back and loves everyone. He’s house trained – both in the sense he does his business outdoors but also because he’s not destructive in the home. There’s no need for using a crate with Sirius and in all honesty, he doesn’t like one. Sirius would do best in a home with people who are around often and probably not with young children as he tends to enjoy a more laid back environment. He has wonderful house manners and just seeks human affection. He would be fine as an only dog or with other low key dogs. He doesn’t pay any mind to cats. Mostly, he loves to play with balls! Sirius is currently in his foster home in MD. He is neutered, up to date on his vaccines and currently undergoing heartworm treatment via the slow kill method. We were worried he may have advanced heartworm disease due to his age, but good news…he does NOT! TLR will follow his treatment and provide all medications until Sirius is heartworm negative, even post adoption. So please don’t let this or his age discourage you, Sirius is a wonderful addition to any family and has so much love to give.Adoption Application http://www.thelastresortrescue.com/adoptionapplication.htm                
03/19/2016	Coco - Chocolate Labrador Retriever / Rottweiler / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler-Unknown Mix	Hewitt, NJ	Female	Posted Breed: Chocolate Labrador Retriever / Rottweiler / Mixed (short coat). www.TheLastResortRescue.com PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET THE FIRST STEP IS TO FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION AVAILABLE AT THELASTRESORTRESCUE.COM. WE CANNOT RESPOND TO GENERAL INQUIRES ABOUT A DOG WITHOUT AN APPLICATION ON FILE.   It's obvious that Coco did not have a great beginning in life but you would never know it from her demeanor. One look at those soulful eyes and she will win you over! She is very sweet and easy-going, is house trained, has good house manners (no jumping or begging at the table) and is good with kids. Coco is a senior, approximately 8 year old, Chocolate Labrador Retriever / Rottweiler mix. Coco was surrendered to a high kill shelter in GA. Her eyes haunted us and on the day she was to be euthanized we were able to save her. Coco was in rough shape. She was extremely emaciated and had large masses on her hips. We took her to the vet immediately. Labs often develop benign skin tumors late in life and that’s what the vet diagnosed Coco with. These are not cancer, nor do they hurt her, they just look so pronounced because she’s so extremely underweight. Coco is heartworm positive and we have begun to treat her using the slow kill method. Don’t let these things deter you – she’s already begun to pick up weight and while still so skinny, she’s making progress! Her chest x-ray is clear and her heartworm case is not advanced. The rescue will provide all medications needed to treat Coco until she is negative. Despite all she’s had to overcome and the amount of neglect this old gal has endured, you would never know it by her demeanor. Coco plays like a pup! She loves to play with toys and bones and has good recall. She is smart and catches on very quickly. She will fit in well in most environments and would be fine with or without dogs or kids. She doesn't need tons of room, either, since she's very mellow even though she weighs 70lbs and has more to go! Her teeth are in good shape, so she may be younger than estimated. Coco has so much to give and her happiness is infectious. We hope you’ll allow her sunshine to fill your days with joy.Adoption Application http://www.thelastresortrescue.com/adoptionapplication.htm                
03/19/2016	Bear - German Shepherd Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Toronto, ON	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (medium coat). Bear is an approx. 9 year old neutered male German Shepherd weighing 110 lbs. He lives with a cat and is used to having people come by. He his also used to playing with young children and other dogs. Since both owners are self-employed his hours of being left alone vary and can be anywhere from a full work day to just 4 hours. He does like people around him.He loves having a backyard and would miss not having one, therefore we are looking for someone who has a house not an apartment or condo. He is not destructive when left alone and is housetrained. His health is excellent and he has a good disposition. He is being rehomed because an elderly relative is moving into the home and is not steady on her feet; she is also intimidated by Bear's size. His rehoming is very emotional for the family, they have had him all his life.

To foster or adopt this dog please call the Delaware County SPCA at 610-566-1370 during adoption hours. You may also email Adoptions@delcospca.org. Can't foster or adopt?

03/19/2016	Tieny - Staffordshire Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Staffordshire Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Princeton, MN	Female	"Posted Breed: Staffordshire Bull Terrier / Mixed. This animal is apart of our ""Seniors For Seniors"" program where we offer senior adopters an opportunity to adopt a pet at a discounted fee. Hi my name is Tieny (or Tiny). It's kind of ironic really, because I'm not all that small. In fact, I could stand to lose some of my ""winter weight."" It would be great to have a family that would help me with that. These past few weeks have been really tough on my and I've been pretty sad and stressed out. You see, I lived my family for most all of my life. I had another fur brother (dog), a kitty friends, and little toddlers to play with who loved me very much. Sadly, my doggie companion passed away and then one of my human brothers got really, really sick. His immune system was compromised and it wasn't healthy for me to be around him anymore I guess, so I was surrendered to a shelter. I was really sad and scared, and when I get excited I sometimes have a hard time breathing. Thankfully, Ruff Start came to see me and realized how totally awesome I am and they placed with me a new foster family who's gonna love me and take care of me until I can find a new family. I'm an older gal, and a little on the larger side, like I said, and a few other medical issues we're going to check out first. Other than my breathing issues, I have some mammary tumors. We think they're benign, but we are going to be sure first. Once my new foster momma gets to know me more I'm sure she'll post tons of awesome information about me. The shelter staff was sure happy, yet sad, to see me go. They all came out to say goodbye and tell me what a good girl I am. I'd love to meet you and show you too what a really good girl I am.                "

03/19/2016	Bao - Golden Retriever (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Retriever	Los Angeles, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Golden Retriever (medium coat). Age: 8 years...Meet Bao. Bao is originally from Taiwan, and he came to the U.S at the end of February. Bao also was rescued from the streets of Taiwan, just like the Turkey dogs, as the same problems with little or no shelters and cast off dogs exists there as well. He is a sweet and loving dog, who has had a rough life , but it has taken a turn for the better for him from now on. Bao not only survived the mean streets of Taiwan-he is also a heart worm survivor and has undergone a splenectomy, both of which have resulted in no lasting impact on his general health. He is truly a survivor, and one of the sweetest dogs you would want to meet. He is house trained, crate trained, and walks well on a leash. He has not had much training, but he is friendly, loving , and a little shy, very mellow and gentle. He is great with kids, and friendly with all dogs he meets. We have not cat tested him as of yet, as we have not met any willing felines, but our feeling is he would probably be okay. He neither barks much, nor digs when left in the yard, but he is a little sad when left there alone. He does not chew what does not belong to him, and has been left alone at home for a few hours with no incident. He is not above a little counter surfing, however, in true golden fashion. As we have seen with many of our Taiwanese dogs, Bao has little interest in toys or bones-they are foreign objects to him. He has likely never had any before. He does like riding in the car, but again, a new experience for him, and not one we recommend he does on a full stomach..lol. He has a pool at his foster home, but has shown no interest in getting in to it. He does not like loud noises or aggressive behavior-they scare him and he will retreat. He just loves to be pet, and loves to hang out with his person all day. Bao would do well in any number of homes, but, possessing a bit of a timid, gentle personality, he would flourish in a peaceful environment He would do well as either an only dog, with a human around a lot of the time, or with another mellow dog for a companion. If properly introduced, cats should not be a problem. If you have completed both your online application and your in-home interview, and think you may be the perfect family for this oh so sweet boy, please contact his rep at bodie99@cox.net  If you have already had a home interview and are interested in meeting, please email at bodie99@cox.net .

03/19/2016	Bella Lab - Labrador Retriever / Shepherd / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Pacific Grove, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Shepherd / Mixed. Bella is a 13-year-old, 55-pound Lab/Shepherd mix. Her foster mom says she's a total love bug who would happily spend all of her time in your lap or cuddled up next to you. She has a ton of energy for a senior and can run circles around much younger dogs. But when it's time to relax at home, she settles down easily - until mealtime, then she perks back up again. She adores going for walks and does great on leash. If you find her getting off track, a slight tug on the leash gets her back in line. Bella loves people, especially her people, and she gets attached very quickly. For instance, when you're on a walk, she constantly looks back to make sure you're there with her. When she's roaming free, one word from you, and she's back at your side.Bella is house-trained and knows basic commands. She completed an obedience class in her puppyhood and still remembers her lessons. She is currently living with a kitty in her foster home that occasionally sparks her attention - she should be fine with a dog-savvy cat in her home. She also gets along with other dogs, though she does compete for your attention. Bella likes to be the top dog. When meeting strangers, Bella is relaxed and friendly. She responds well to correction and is easy to train. Bella came to POMDR with Gus, who is also available for adoption. Although we would love to find them a home together, we believe they would be fine if separated.

Happy friendly loving and smart that's me Stormy. If you are looking for a dog who is good with other animals (except birds) and children and you either work from home or are retired I might be the best choice for you. I do need a home where I am with my person most of the time because I protest loudly when I am apart from my people so apartment living is not for me. If you are looking for a constant loyal companion look no further. I have been trained as a hunting dog and love training and working but I am on the older side so shorter days in the field are best. If you love me but can't adopt me please ask about sponsorship.   Located in Adoption Dogs 19

United Hope for Animals (UHA) is a volunteer group and does not have a facility for animals. This pet is part of our Shelter Support Program at the Baldwin Park Shelter. For more information about the pet, the adoption process, or our program please contact the Volunteer Adoption Coordinator listed below. Because animals are adopted/rescued daily, please also check the United Hope for Animals Facebook page to see if an animal is still available OR call the Baldwin Park Shelter at 626-962-3577. When inquiring about an animal, please reference the animal’s ID number. This will enable the volunteer or Baldwin Park employee to locate the status of the pet. Thank you for supporting rescue. Pet Information CONTACT: UHA ADOPTION COORDINATOR KRISTIN AT 626-393-6258 OR AT kristin@hope4animals.org Description: A4925235 Bernie is a 10-year-old black-and-tan male Bernese Mountain Dog and German Shepherd mix who came to the Baldwin Park Animal Care Center on March 4th as a stray from Baldwin Park. Weighing 60 lbs, Bernie shows signs of being housebroken, walks well on leash, takes treats like a complete gentleman, thinks humans are quite nice, and is sweet, calm, and loving. His handler had no problems with him and decided to do a run through the cat building. Bernie walked by all the cages of cats and just leisurely looked at them and kept on going. So, obviously, we think he may be a candidate for a home with a cat. Bernie is quite sweet and endearing, so we’re thinking this personable older guy would be a swell indoor pet and companion for an individual who wants a low-key housemate, or a family who wants a big love muffin for their very own.

Millie, a beautiful senior chocolate lab is part of our vintage collection. This young at heart senior has lots of life left in her. She has raised way too many puppies, and says thankfully those days are over!  Millie has been fostered with cats and appears to be cat tolerant after proper introduction she ignored them in a few days.  This sassy spunky gal just has one main need: to be your one and only! Millie having lived the life of a ""breeder"" dog sadly never learned to interact properly with other dogs. Her inclination is to react and be unsocial. Our professional trainer has worked with Millie to soften these traits but it would be best for her to be in an ""only dog"" household.  Millie would love to be in a home where her people were around during the day, she loves being indoors with her people and craves to be their constant companion. She would also be fine with a family, that can check in on her frequently. She's perfectly happy lounging indoors or out.  As we all know with age our bodies get a little lumpy and not quite as fit and firm. Millie may look a little aged but her spirit and energy would rival a dog half her age!  For Millie’s health and wellbeing, she will benefit form continuing a high quality diet and arthritis pain supplements to keep her feeling her best.  Millie is finally ready for a real family who will treat her as one of their own. She will in turn, be your faithful friend, always there by your side.

Thanks so much for stopping by. I'd like to tell you a little about myself. My name is Mooch and I am a senior lady with lots of love to give. I used to live in Virginia and my life wasn't that good. You see, I was in a home and its seems that my family kept me isolated and they didn't teach me how to get along with other dogs. I was then left at a scary shelter where there were lots of dogs and cats that were quite noisy.  I'm now at a point in my life where I just want a human companion all to myself. I am very loving, like to snuggle, watch tv, and lay outside in the sunshine. I am spayed, up-date-on shots, microchipped and on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. If you would like to help me enjoy the rest of my life being loved and cherished, I promise I will be your best buddy. Please fill out an adoption or foster application at www.allmuttsmatter.org. Below is our adoption process.   1. The application will be processed, evaluated and we will contact the vet and personal references; 2. All other applications that have been submitted on Mooch will also be processed (best suited applicant is chosen, not first come first serve); 3. Schedule a home visit; and 4. Adoption finalized when the best-fitting home is found. Our adoption fee for Mooch is $150.00.                
03/19/2016	Legend - Treeing Walker Coonhound (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Treeing Walker Coonhound	Athens, AL	Male	"Posted Breed: Treeing Walker Coonhound (short coat). Legend has a sad tale to tell. He is a registered Walker hound. He is 9 years old, but he has been turned in to the Athens Limestone  Animal Shelter by his owner because his owner ""is no longer able to hunt""! By the looks of this sweet senior gentleman, it has been quite a while since he has been hunting anything other than his food bowl anyway. He seems to be gentle in temperament, and shows absolutely no signs of aggression, and other than being slightly overweight, he seems to be in good health. He just seemed to wander aimlessly around the yard while I was getting these photos, though, which would seem to indicate that he is depressed and confused in the unfamiliar surroundings. I'm sure he misses his home, as well. He showed little interest in treats and was not inclined to approach me to be petted, although I did coax him to come to me so I could show him some attention and he did let me pet him. Legend just needs to be welcomed into a good home where he will be given time to adapt and a lot of attention. There is a very, very sweet old fella hiding inside that beautiful outside appearance.                "

The staff is getting me all ready to go home with someone wonderful maybe you?

03/19/2016	Finch - Golden Retriever (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Retriever	Los Angeles, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Golden Retriever (medium coat). Age: 10 years...This lovely gent, sporting his favorite puppy cut, is Finch, and he is all of 10 years young! Finch lived with his dad for a very long time, since he was a pup, but his mom got really sick and could no longer have a dog in the house, so he came to us looking for a new home. And since he is such a wonderful pup,we know we will find him one. Finch is a true gentleman. He is loving to everyone he meets, even little yappy dogs that may lunge at him or try and nip him-he remains above the fray. He greets all with a wagging tail and a big smile, and people are just drawn to him-they all want to pet him-a task he gladly rises to. He also has excellent house manners, and will prompt you, with a slight whine, when he needs to go outside. When left inside, which he immensely prefers, he is totally trustworthy, generally just napping with his foster fur brother, who is the same age. He is getting a little harder of hearing now, in his mature years, although that doesn’t slow him down one bit. And don’t let his age fool you-he enjoys wrestling, ball chasing, tug of war, and squeaky toys-he loves getting new ones! He enjoys cruising in the car-he will stick his head out to catch all the smells! And he really loves his walks and hikes, taking everything in! Finch is a playful, friendly, very loving and smart dog, with a super personality. He knows a few basic commands, but has never had any formal training. He has lived with young children, and he is wonderful with them. He loves being showered with attention and love, no matter where or whom it comes from- petting him can be endless, but if you give him a few minutes of your time with hugs and body rubs, he knows you still love him and will be content. While he loves dogs and people, we have been told he does not appear to like cats very much, as he displays a very high prey drive, so no kitties for this boy. He is on inexpensive thyroid medication, which he will need to continue, and also is extremely sensitive to fleas and their bites, so someone who would remain on top of his monthly flea meds, and give him his medicated shampoos, as needed, to keep his skin healthy and allergy free is a must. Finch is looking for that perfect home to spend his golden years in. He would fit in any number of homes, and would really enjoy a canine companion to hang out with, as well. If you have completed your application process, including your application and your in-home interview, and would like to provide Finch that great home, please contact his rep at bodie99@cox.net  If you have already had a home interview and are interested in meeting, please email at bodie99@cox.net .

03/19/2016	Hunter - COURTESY LISTING - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Lee's Summit, MO	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Furry Kids' Refuge needs NEWSPAPERS & Adult Dry dog food (without colored pieces, please). If you would like to donate, you can drop off your donation at our weekly adoption events held at the Lee's Summit Petco every Saturday from Noon to 4pm. Thank you!COURTESY LISTING  PLEASE CONTACT MARY HODGES  mmlbh27@gmail.com  FOR MORE INFORMATION    DOB: August 2006 Approx weight: 55 lbs  NO CHILDREN PLEASE!!   Hunter is a 9 1/2 year old lab mix. He was adopted from a shelter when he was 3 years old and has been a wonderful companion. His parents recently added a human baby to the pack and this seems to have made Hunter insecure. Because of this, his parents have decided that another home would be a better fit for him at this time.   Hunter is a great balance because he loves to run at the dog park and go on long walks or jogs but he will also snuggle up with you and loves to be petted. He is very food oriented so kitchen counters need to be clear and kitchen trash needs to be locked away. He knows the following commands: sit, down, turn around, wait, roll over and play dead. He is used to living indoors and while he does enjoy periods of time outdoors with human companions, he needs a home where he will primarily be indoors. He currently is the only pet in his home but he does get along well with other dogs at the dog park. He has a strong interest in small animals such as squirrels and cats, so to be on the safe side, there should not be a cat in his new home.    Hunter takes one prescription medication once daily and needs periodic lab work related to this medication. He is housetrained but does need to be let out to pee on a regular basis (every 4-5 hours) during the day but does fine for 8-9 hours overnight. Hunter has been neutered, vaccinated, heartworm tested negative at his annual physical and is microchipped.     COURTESY LISTING PLEASE CONTACT MARY HODGES  mmlbh27@gmail.com  FOR MORE INFORMATION    Would you like to foster a Furry Kid? Furry Kids' Refuge will supply the food & vet care while you supply the basic house rules & love.......win-win for all!!

03/19/2016	Benny Hill - Golden Retriever / Labrador Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Labrador	Brooklyn, NY	Male	Posted Breed: Golden Retriever / Labrador Retriever / Mixed. Badass Benny Hill is on his way from Texas this weekend after narrowly escaping the shelter! 10 to 12 years old, Benny got surrendered to an overcrowded shelter because they were moving. He clocked in at nearly 125 pounds when he came in in January and just didn't look like he was in good condition. We saw his sweet, smiling face and couldn't r esist. No dog deserves for things to end like this! As you can see from the photo on the right, Benny's grin only widened when we sprung him. Benny's a bit creaky with arthritis as you'd expect, but he's improving with anti-inflammatories and taking off some of those extra pounds. More importantly, he's got a wonderful temperament and so much to offer a Badass family. Note that he doesn't like the vet much, but he's otherwise a friend to everybody. Benny's good with other dogs and people of all ages. He's housebroken, cratetrained, and just want someone Badass to share his golden years with. Benny is neutered, UTD on vaccinations, and microchipped. To foster or adopt, please visit our website at www.badassbk.com for an application.

03/19/2016	Hank - Labrador Retriever / Great Dane / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Great Dane-Labrador Retriever Mix	Phoenix, AZ	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Great Dane / Mixed (medium coat). Hank – Labrador / Great Dane mix – 9 years old – Male This dashingly handsome boy we lovingly call Hank! Hank is one of Stealing Hearts “special” dogs, he is a member of our “Steel Grey Curtain” program which means he may have a little grey on his muzzle but he’s still very young at heart! Unbelievingly he was dumped at a kill shelter right before Christmas so his so called family could get a new puppy for Christmas!  Sadly dogs that have a “few years” on them have very little chance of getting out of those shelters. But not our Hank! One look at his adorable face and we swooped him right up! SHR made sure he got a check-up by a vet and took care of his medical needs. Hank has been living with a foster family since that day and they have the most wonderful things to say about him. (From Hank’s foster mom) Hank is sweet, loving and has the most adorable droopy eyes, his tail never stops wagging. He loves bubble baths, walks and dinner with friends. Occasionally he’s up for a short game of fetch but is just as happy roaming the backyard enjoying the outdoors. After a busy day, Hank will stretch out on a blanket or “share” the sofa and take a long nap. We have learned so much about our big goofy boy since he came to us. We know that he is house trained, kennel trained, is great on a leash and knows basic commands. He also loves to go for car rides. We are so happy we’re able to give Hank the chance to live the rest of his life surrounded by love and we know when his new family finds him they’ll feel like they hit the lottery!  For more information on Hank please call Toni at 602-686-4158 or email azbullygirl@hotmail.com

Please contact melissa (melissa.martie@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Hi! My name is Chesney and I am a sweet boy. I was a stray, so they don't know a lot about me, including my age! They tell me I might be as old as 10. I weigh around 60 pounds and love to spend time with my Foster Mom (and all her friends!) giving them lots of kisses! Right now I live with a 1 year old boxer and a puppy. I like my fellow boxer because she will play with me, but also gives me my space when I want it. I don't mind the puppy, but he doesn't always understand that I like my quiet couch time. I love to curl up on the couch, especially if my Foster Mom is with me! I hesitate when someone tries to pat me on the top of my head. I love back rubs though! Because I am not always sure about head rubs, my Foster Mom says I should not go to a home with small children because they might not understand how to approach me. A home with older children or no children would be perfect for me! I get very excited when I hear my Foster Mom say ""outside"" (I will show you the boxer wiggle!). I also know how to sit and shake.  My adoption fee is $150. I am neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, and up-to-date on vaccines.   Please fill out an adoption application today at www.pawsandprayers.org. I can’t wait to meet you!                "

Don''t worry though, I just like being nice and close, and I''m very cuddly for my size! What can I say? I like getting lots of love and affection, just as much as I love to show it! When it comes to other dogs, I do get along with them quite well, I don''t hold any grudges. However, I''m really not as playful as most other dogs can be. I tend to just enjoy their company and being around them, but I''d much rather play with my human pals instead. So, do you think we''d get along alright? I''m sure we would, I just know it!

We took in Kayla the other day when she had run out of time at the pound. She had been adopted out and brought back because she has too much herding instinct for small children and needs a refresher on her obedience. I am not sure how they figured this out but the paperwork says she is 11 years old. Looks really good for 11 and still gets around fine. If anybody would like to invite a senior to spend her last years in their home please consider Kayla, she is ready to go home today.  PLEASE e-mail (do not call) mike@caaronline.org for more information and to set up an appointment to adopt. Do not e-mail us with a request to call you, if you have a question please ask in the e-mail.   All dog are adopted on a first come - first served basis. Central Arizona Animal Rescue is a not-for-profit 501(c)3 corporation. We are located in San Tan Valley, AZ. If you have other dogs already, you must bring them for introduction prior to adoption.

03/19/2016	Capt. Jack Sparrow - Shepherd / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Poughkeepsie, GA	Male	Posted Breed: Shepherd / Mixed (short coat). Capt. JACK SPARROW has stolen our hearts. This gentle older guy wants nothing more than to hang out with his person. His world was turned upside down when his owner died and he found himself at the shelter along with his doggie friend. He had ulcers in his eyes and though he was initially adopted, he was returned after a visit to the vet determined that one eye needed to be removed and it wasn't sure if the other eye could be saved. One of our wonderful fosters offered to take him through surgery and PPR was able to rescue him. One eye was removed, but thanks to the fosters dedication to his treatment, (and the wonderful care he received from our vet), his other eye was saved. Understandably Jack presents as a tad shy when you first meet him and his new owner needs to be patient as he adjusts to his new family. They will be rewarded with a loving companion, that is smart and well behaved. Jack loves with his whole heart and will be a very loyal friend. He is well mannered in the house and doesn't need to be crated. A nice soft bed and he is very happy. He doesn't bark but squeals and wiggles in anticipation of a walk or a play session with his tennis balls. He even tries to put two in his mouth at the same time!Jack would be perfect for a quieter home. He is shy around new people until he gets to know them and with losing sight in one eye, we think kids could be too hectic for him. He lived with another dog and is in a foster home with several dogs, but he doesn't want to play with them. Again that may just be they take him surprise when they come up on his blind side. We think Jack is around 6 years old and weighs 60lbs.Jack qualifies for our Grey Muzzle Senior Adoption donation of $100. He has been vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, heartworm tested negative and neutered.Please visit our website www.perfectpetsrescue.org and submit an application to adopt if you would like to talk to the foster family and get more information on this pet.                
03/19/2016	Sebastian - German Shepherd Dog Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Newport Beach, CA	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog. 9 year old Sebastian has endured hardships for most of his life. However, even that did not prepare him for how his owners ended their ties to him.  He was left not AT a high kill shelter, but instead dumped on the street in front of the shelter. They could not even be bothered with doing the paperwork to ensure he safely off the busy street. Sebastian came to us with some serious skin issues. They have been treated and we hope that soon he will be returned to his former glory.  He is a friendly guy and appears to like other big dogs. He may look like an older, lumbering kinda guy – but when he sees a small dog, he demonstrates how quickly he can move! No small dogs for this guy.Please go to our website and complete an adoption application at: http://www.gsroc.org/application.asp. An adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.

03/19/2016	Axel - Black Labrador Retriever Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Salt Lake City, UT	Male	Posted Breed: Black Labrador Retriever. Hi my name is Axel I am a 10 year old labrador retriever mix. My foster parents believe that I may be mixed with border collie. I have been though a lot to get to where I am. I was abandoned at the shelter with a mass growing on my abdomen that was 8 pounds and nearly touched the ground. After being rescued I went to surgery and had it removed and my teeth cleaned. Good news it was not cancer, just a fatty mass. I am a new dog!! I love to run and play with the dogs and children in my foster home. I would be a great dog for someone who wants a buddy, I love to walk, hike, and sleep on the bed. I do have some other masses on my body, none of which are a problem at this time, but they will need to be watched closely as I age. Recently the vet did an ultrasound & it was determined that Axel has an enlarged heart, so heavy exercise should be done in cool weather, but he should still have some nice years ahead of him. Can you give this senior guy his forever family? If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out the Online Application!

Hello! No, there's no echo in here... there's two of us! We're Bobby and Molli, and we're hanging out in Albany, Oregon with our foster family, hoping and crossing our paws that someone's going to realize that two wet dog noses are better than one, and give us a home together! Because we've been together forever, and we'd really, really like to stay that way! Our foster mom says we are the best fosters she has ever had! That’s a direct quote (I heard her say it to a lady on the phone). I think it’s because we are just so darn cool. My sister, Molli, and I come from the great outdoors, but we’ve taken to the indoors like bees to honey. And let me tell you, this indoor thing is SWEET! We’ve got fluffy beds in our crates and there are three boys that give us treats when we sit and smile. And let me tell you, we are doing A LOT of smiling. Some of our favorite things to do include taking walks around the neighborhood, watching the kids play at the park, and running along the river bank in the woods. We are the kind of dogs you can take anywhere! And, we get along with EVERYONE! We like babies and toddlers, little kids, big kids, new people we meet at the park, all our foster parent’s friends, our foster fur brother, the mailman, and even the kitty! Sometimes other dogs will walk by the window and we are just so excited, we let them know. Our mom tells us that we don’t have to talk to everyone, and we understand that, but we’re just so happy to tell people our story! Hopefully we will find a great family to adopt us in our next chapter… Please fill out our application soon! http://www.nwboxerrescue.org/#!adoption-form/c1dw9  If you would like to adopt her, fill out an adoption application on our website www.nwboxerrescue.org    Like us on facebook for more photos of this pretty girl, as well as other boxers we have available! www.facebook.com/northwestboxerrescue

03/19/2016	Joe - Boxer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Woodinville, WA	Male	Posted Breed: Boxer (short coat). ~~Joe 8 year old male Dog Friendly Kid Friendly Crate Trained Perfect walker Hi my name is Joe. I am a very handsome good looking guy. I have cropped ears that just adds to my gorgeous manly look. I have good manners and love to please you. I bark when there is someone coming to the door, up the driveway or hear something unusual, so I am a great alarm security without the monthly bill. I like to look out for my family and let them know when things are around that we don’t recognize. I am crate trained and love my Kong at quiet time. I get along great with my dogs here, both big and small. I am potty trained and have had no marking or accidents at my foster home. If I need to go out and do my business, I will talk to you and run to the door. In my previous home I got beat up by other big dogs so I am on the reserved side when meeting dogs or people sometimes. My foster mom has been taking me out on outtings to get me comfortable and learn to trust again, showing me she will keep me safe from harm and I am doing great. I love to go for walks and my mom says I am the best walker she has ever had the pleasure of walking. I love to go for car rides and am a very good boy while traveling. I am more of a layed back dog and not hyper yet I can bounce around when I want to play. I do not jump up on people so am very respectful of you. I am very treat motivated and know how to sit, wait, down and shake. I listen very well and come when I am called. I love kids but older respectful ones would be the best fit for me since I appreciate the calm and quiet. I can sleep on my dog bed at night or on the bed with you is where I prefer but of course that is your call. I bond to my person and will follow you around the house to see what you are up to and make sure you know I am close by if you miss me. I have not been around a cat so not sure how I would do with them but can be tested soon to see. So if you are looking for a great loyal companion to make your life complete and whole, look no further, I am here waiting for you to welcome me into your forever home. I am being fostered and loved in Woodinville, Wa.

03/19/2016	Lucy 2 - Boxer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Woodinville, WA	Female	Posted Breed: Boxer (short coat). My name is Lucy. (NWBR calls me Lucy 2 just to avoid confusion with the other Lucy.) You guessed it, I am a little female Boxer, fawn in color, with full dark brown eyes, wearing a white chest and little white boots on all four feet and my foster dad says that I am a middle weight powerhouse, weighing in at 55 pounds and made up of nothing but bone, sinew, and muscle. He calls me Miss Arnold Schwarzenegger on occasion when being introduced to his friends and other people. Indeed, I am ﬁt as a ﬁddle and before I came to NWBR, I was owned by a lovely lady named Whitney who ran 5 miles with me most everyday when we lived in Colorado. Her changing job locations just made it difﬁcult for me and in my best interest, she surrendered me to NWBR. Now this you will not believe, but I must tell you that I am 7 years old and will be 8 on April 26, 2016. Foster Dad and Mom could not believe it either, but it is a fact. I’ve been well taken care of, fed properly, and have had beaucoup exercise daily to keep me young. Oh…and I am pretty dang smart too. I came to Foster Dad and Mom on February 28, 2016. I was actually picked up by Dad who also works in the transport service of NWBR. I met his two Boxers Mr. Boo and Samantha that day. Mr. Boo took to me right away and Samantha was just a bit shy initially for I am a bit bold in my approach to other dogs and humans and feel right at home with all those I have met so far. Boo and I hung out together on the ride home to Harrison, Idaho while Samantha chose to ride in the crate which was meant for me. We critters are just like children and must be taught boundaries and signals and language so that we all understand each other. Foster Dad was pretty surprised when I showed him my stuff. He said, “Lucy…Sit.” And I sat. He said, “Lucy…Down.” And I went down. He put a lead on me and said, “Lucy…Heel.” And I heeled. Every once in a while I get slightly ahead of Foster Dad and with a slight touch on the lead I am in lock step right beside him. I have been trained with traditional dog hand signals combined with vocal commands. I just learned a new signal this week. Foster Dad has me sit before I eat. He also commands, “Lucy…Watch Me.” And I look up into his eyes where we make good eye contact for a second or two and then he says, “Eat um up!” That command is easy! Currently we are working on the “Wait” (Stay) and “Come” (when called) command. I am so bright that I think I’ll have these down in no time al all. By the way I have never been kenneled or crate trained by previous owner. Crate training is just starting and I think I’ll get the hang of it soon. Although I like to believe I am a sweetie pie, and fairly low key and calm (especially in the house), I do get amped up when it is playtime or time for a hike. I play hard with Mr. Boo, who is almost 9, and I use my front paws to hit a little hard while rough housing. But he puts me in my place as necessary and after that, “all is good”. We hike in the woods and along the river almost daily as we are only 10 minutes from US Forest Service Land and Idaho State Land. We’ve been watching the geese and swan migrations now and we spooked a small herd of eight elk recently too. What a perfect place to spend time each day, don’t you think? So, dear reader, I’m asking you to look carefully at yourself to truly see if you are my type. Are you an athlete? Do you like to run, hike, or mountain bike often? Do you have kids who will hang with me? Will you continue to train me in the important commands so I don’t falter once when you ask me to do something? Will you feed me properly and keep me in good health with routine visits to the Vet? Will you put good energy into me and play with me and when it is time, just cozy up on the ﬂoor with me and kick back for a while and love on me? If all the above is a “Yes” then perhaps our relationship could be the very best of love stories.

COURTESY LISTINGTHIS IS NOT A BULLY PAWS DOG. COURTESY LISTINGS ARE LISTED BY THEIR CURRENT OWNERS OR RESCUERS AND HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY BULLY PAWS.IF THIS DOG IS CURRENTLY IN A RESCUE OR FOSTER HOME, YOU WILL SEE THE CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW. IF THERE IS NO CONTACT INFORMATION LISTED, PLEASE CONTACT OUR REHOMING COORDINATOR AT STEPHANIE@BULLYPAWS.ORG.  Diamond is a perfect name because her eyes sparkle and shine! Her previous owner had landlord issues and she was surrendered to the Anne Arundel County Maryland SPCA. Our enrichment training team has been working with Diamond for a few months and this girl does NOT act her age! She is full of playful energy, loves to go on long walks, and has an adorable silly side.  Diamond is completely house trained and will not pee or poop inside of her run; this makes her a great new addition to any home that is worried about the tedious work involved in potty-training a dog. Diamond also knows a bunch of standard obedience commands such as sit, down and place. She is very receptive to crunchy treats and wags her tail in delight when she connects with her handler and knows she is doing positive behaviors.Diamond can be dog reactive and therefore should be the only pet in her new home. Diamond is nervous around small children, so an adult household would suit her best. We believe Diamond’s perfect match is an experienced American Pitt Bull Terrier owner that understands all the wonderful characteristics and specific quirks of the breed. Diamond would excel in an environment where her owner sets healthy expectations and provides leadership in a calm, stable environment. The right combination of healthy exercise, leadership and love will make this “diamond in the rough” shine even brighter! Diamond’s adoption fee has been pre-paid by a sponsor. If you are interested in meeting Diamond or getting more information about her, please contact the Anne Arundel County Maryland SPCA at 410-268-4388 x102 or email mkoslof@gmail.com

03/19/2016	Jonas - Boxer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Oceanside, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Boxer (short coat). Our handsome Jonas came to us from our friends at the San Diego County Central Shelter where he was being overlooked simply due to his age and not showing well to the general public … probably due to his stress of finding himself lost and in an unfamiliar place. He’s an older Boxer, approximately 7-8 years of age, and he loves every human he meets! He is best as an only dog, as he’s shown to be quite dog reactive at our adoption center/kennel facility. Fortunately for Jonas, he has an amazing volunteer who takes him to her place of employment several times a week … where he gets to hang out with people all day long and be JUST a little spoiled by her! Jonas would LOVE to find a home to call his own. If you’re interested in meeting Jonas, please contact our adoption coordinator at “info@lastchanceatlife.org”                
03/19/2016	BAYLEY - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Springfield, MA	Female	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat). This chunky cutie is named Bayley. She is an 8 year old spayed white and tan Labrador Retriever mix. Bayley will need to be the only pet in the home, and her home should have adults only. Bayley is very smart, and doing fantastic with learning the basics. She is housebroken and has learned a handful of commands such as sit, down, and shake. Her new family should consider continuing training classes to learn the house rules, increase socialization with people and dogs, to increase her confidence, and to help bond with her new peoples. Bayley will need a patient and loving forever home to show her what love is and allow her to trust again. She has been insecure and worried since she has gotten here, but has made tremendous strides that show she is a resilient and amazing doggie. She has increasingly let down her guard and let strangers approach her. She loves going for walks, and her tail wags the entire time she is outside. She also loves getting treats, and loves to earn them as rewards. She is a low energy type of girl, and once adjusted to her new home she should be fairly laid back. If you have some love and patience to give to a lovely girl in need, then please come by and meet Bayley!The Next step in adopting a new companion from Thomas J O''Connor would be to come into the shelter during our adoption hours** for a meet and greet.

He is already housebroken, and has learned basic commands such as sit, down and speak. Continued training will help curb any negative behaviors such as leash pulling and demand barking, and increasing socialization with other dogs. Juggernaut has a very nice energy level for his size, but will still need daily exercise outside the home and yard. He really has a great personality and has quickly become a staff favorite. He is happy to meet everyone, and always greets strangers with a kiss.

Have a question? Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.   Statistics    Name: Marshall Breed: Akita/German Shepherd Mix Age: 10 Years Size: Large Adoption Donation: $180 (applicable sales tax included). Adoption fees may be paid with cash or check. Other: Neutered Male, vaccinations current, microchip    ** Marshall qualifies for our Seniors for Seniors Program. This program places senior dogs (age 10 or older) with senior citizens (age 65 or older) at a reduced adoption fee of $65.00. If you qualify and are interested in participating in this program, please fill out an application on line and type ""SENIOR"" after your name.    Marshall is looking for a wonderful home for a good boy!        Foster Home Feedback   3/14/16: Marshall is an older, large Akita mix. He is very polite and well-mannered. He knows basic commands, and is very treat motivated. He hardly barks. A 6' fence is suggested, as he escaped my 4' fence with ease one time, but only after being outside too long. (He barked to come in, and I think he got bored- my neighbor was outside to witness.) He does great on walks, isn't much of a puller. He does not need a high level of activity. Great with kids, cats, and other dogs. He does have some separation anxiety and he does not like to be crated. I leave him loose in my house when I work and he does well. Marshall would do great in a home with another dog. He is soft and snuggly. Loves to cuddle, and is always by my side. He isn't much for furniture, nor a bed sleeper, but sleeps right next to my bed.  Marshall has had a few accidents inside, but he has been intact with two other males in the house, and I believe he was marking -- is it is not a large amount. He does not mark while I am home, however, so it could also be connected to his separation anxiety. Once he is neutered, I believe this will resolve itself. Please considering giving this laid back, polite gentleman, a home to call his own.  To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org                "

He is really easy going and can just spend the day with you lazying around watching movies or running around throwing the ball in the backyard- he is super flexible! He loves getting his belly rubbed and also being pet on his head. On hot summer days, he loves to sleep on our cold wood floor. He is not a huge of the rain and needs a strong leader to help him on walks (he is extremely protective of us when other dogs are around). He is not at all fussy about being in his crate when we are off to work and sleeps on the floor in our bedroom with us at night to keep us safe. We are really sad to be giving him up for adoption but feel that he will have more freedom in home without a toddler.

03/19/2016	Ol' Henry (senior) - American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Fredericksburg, VA	Male	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). Henry has been our foster since April of 2015. During that time we have gotten to know Henry as a very affectionate, gentle soul who truly loves to be in the company of his human family. He eagerly follows his foster mom around the yard and house, while not being in the way.  Henry lives for his daily walk around the neighborhood, parks or along the river. He enjoyed going for a swim in the river in the summer and loved retrieving sticks that we threw for him. He has the energy and stamina of a much younger dog and can easily go for a brisk, one hour long walk.  Henry loves riding in the car and visiting stores. He enjoys meeting new people and has been very gentle with children and adults.  He is very tolerant of the one cat in our home, and has learned that “the old lady” needs to be left in peace. Henry does not like having other dogs in his space and especially not in his face, so needs to be kept away from other dogs. He is an older fellow who just cannot be bothered. He has not shown any aggression towards other dogs when walking him and is easily re-directed, but we keep a good distance between us and other strange dogs.  We would love for Henry to have a home of his own, especially since we need to keep him separate from all our other dogs. He does need to be the only dog in the home, but this enigmatic guy will make the most wonderful companion that you can hope for. Henry does have that one little tick in as he likes snapping his mouth together when he gets excited or nervous. It has taken people by surprise but is not a sign of aggression. When Henry gets a new toy or a new bone to chew on, he usually throws it in the air or places it on the ground and then runs around it all excited before playing or chewing on it. He enjoys it when we play ball with him and loves his jolly balls. He has discovered how much fun it is to hunt for moles in the yard and has been immensely helpful by turning over the soil.  Henry truly is an absolutely wonderful dog and would make a great companion and life long friend. Thank you for your interest in Henry.                
03/19/2016	Kana- Courtesy Listing - Rottweiler / Black Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler-Unknown Mix	Fredericksburg, VA	Female	Posted Breed: Rottweiler / Black Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat). Hi there, my name is Kana! I love going for walks and swimming in the river. I'm a very unique dog, and I'm looking for the perfect match-could it be you? I have some pretty sweet training under my belt, I got to spend a couple weeks hanging out with the trainers who were voted the BEST in Northern Virginia for 2014! My training was to help me with my confidence, as I have some insecurities with people and other dogs. It has helped me so much, so I need my person to be committed to keeping up with it! I know some incredibly useful commands, including commands from a distance. We can practice from opposite ends of a soccer field! How cool is that?! I love practicing my training, not only does it help improve my self-esteem, but it also provides great mental and physical exercise! I was 20lbs overweight when I came to my foster home, and am finally back to my ideal weight-I'd love to keep it that way :)   I am looking for a calm, quiet home where I can live out the rest of my years as an only child. I am a bit skittish, so children and quick movements really scare me. I just need someone who likes to take it easy and will be patient in getting to know me, but I promise to be an amazing companion once I settle in and learn to trust you! I am the perfect balance of independent, yet loving. I would love a companion that is familiar with dog body language and behavior, as that will accelerate my acclimations in trusting you and is good for letting you know when I would like some alone time. I'm an older lady, and have a lot to reflect upon! I like some alone time to clear my head of bad memories so that I can make room for new, happy memories with you!  I need to be the only pet in the home, as I said earlier, I am a bit insecure and sharing the attention with another pet really stresses me out. I enjoy meeting up with my dog friends for walks, though. I just have my own personal space bubble that I request be respected.    If you are looking for an obedient, medium energy dog, we may be a great fit for each other! I'd love to meet you to see if we have a special connection, so please don't hesistate to contact my foster mom so we can get together for a nice walk :)   I was recently tested with a cool, laid-back cat. He was nice, we sniffed each other a few times, but I could smell where the resident dog bowl usually sits so I was WAY more interested in that! I met a different cat a few weeks later, and was great with him too, even when he hissed and meowed at me. I haven't lived with a cat before though, so if you have one I will need some time to adjust, but I think I could get used to it!

03/19/2016	Off-Site Foster Willow - Shepherd / Mixed (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Virginia Beach, VA	Female	Posted Breed: Shepherd / Mixed (long coat). Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!   Willow is a soulful, mature, 60 pound shepherd mix lady that is looking for a retirement home that will promise to love her to the moon and back forever and always. That shouldn't be too much to ask especially with a girl like Willow. This is Willow's second time with us and we would absolutely love for it to be her last. We love seeing our alumni, but we prefer that they only come back and visit with their families! Willow is a wonderful dog that is house trained, likes cats and is good with kids. She would do best as the only dog in the home is what her last family said. She's an easy going girl that will make a great addition to the right family. She's calm and would love to have the job of keeping someone company! Willow was returned as her family said she couldn't always hold her bladder and she couldn't climb the steps in the 2 story home. Not trying to make this about her being returned, just want everyone to know what will be needed for Willow. Probably a single story home were she can be taken out more often. The family also said they didn't take her to the vet, so there is a possibility she could have something going on that was making it hard for her to hold her bladder. Either way, she's an older girl, so please, if you going to have a heart of gold and decide to give Willow or any of our seniors a home, please make sure you are in it for the long haul. Seniors are great creatures that want and need love and respect just like all the rest of us. If think you may have a place in your heart and home for a girl like Willow and you want to wake each morning to that wonky ear and those crazy teeth smiling at you then please stop by soon and meet her. Willow is currently in foster care so if you would like to meet her, please call the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center at 757-385-4444 and they can get you in touch with her foster family.

03/19/2016	Nena - Belgian Shepherd Malinois (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Bakersfield, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Belgian Shepherd Malinois (medium coat). Nena, is a gorgeous Belgian Malinois who rescued from a high kill shelter after she was found as a stray. Her status was 'rescue only' due to her medical condition. Poor Nena had several tumors on her abdomen. We saw her beauty and had to step in. All of her tumors have been removed and she has been spayed. She has recovered 100% and is now ready for adoption. Nena likes the ball but does not have the strong drive often seen in the breed. She prefers to play for short periods of time.Nena gets along with other dogs but should avoid cats. She is house broken and crate trained. There are so many positives about this girl. She is calm and laid back. Although she can be energetic she is not high strung. Her age is a puzzle but we will definately categorize her as 'mature'.... whatever her age may be...Nena is still full of life and has so much love to give. If this is your breed and you are looking for one on the mellow side,,,you will want to meet our sweet girl. She is up to date on shots, microchipped and spayed. Her adoption fee is $300. and helps us to save another shelter dog!

Hello my name is Moby        I LOVE being around people. I like dogs too, but people I want to be around all the time! I will climb up in your lap if you let me. They tell me I'm a little too big to be a lap dog, but I have so much love to share!        I have been with the rescue for several years and am ready to find my forever home. I am goofy, fun-loving, loyal dog who will do anything to make you laugh. I am super smart and highly food motivated!  In my golden years I have developed some vision issues, my vet basically compared it to me having to look through snow globes.  It does not stop me from finding the food though. I would basically do anything for a treat. My canine friends these days are usually the more passive type, although I have been friends with some very dominant females in the past. No kitties for me please  I would love to live in a home with someone who worked minimal hours and could hang out with me often. I like walks but they don't need to be to long- I love to play ball.     I am an all around wonderful dog who so would love to have a family of my own. Please come and meet me so I can give you kisses.    Love,   Moby                
03/19/2016	DALTON - Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Belleville, MI	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). Dalton is a big ham and we just can't figure out why he's still with us. This boy is one of the most handsome of the bunch - our pictures just don't do him justice. He is a beautiful chocolate red male who has some of the most stunning physical definition we've ever seen. We're thinking he might be a good training partner for a Navy SEAL or maybe someone training for an Iron Man competition - we challenge you to keep up with our D-Man! Dalton is a good boy in his crate and loves car rides and playing fetch. He is definitely a high energy boy who will need to go to an experienced bully home. Did we mention he's got a remarkable vertical leap? Dalton would probably do best paired with a submissive female or as an only dog. As far as people go, he loves everybody - he'll bounce up to your eye level just to show you! He will greatly benefit from anybody willing to give him the training and extensive exercise that he needs.                
03/19/2016	Pearl (senior) - Yellow Labrador Retriever / Chow Chow / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chow Chow-Unknown Mix	Fredericksburg, VA	Female	"Posted Breed: Yellow Labrador Retriever / Chow Chow / Mixed (medium coat). The world is your oyster, and this sweet girl will be your devoted Pearl! Pearl adores humans with the dedication of a lifelong companion. She's faithfully focused on her handler, constantly looking for direction. An absolute sweetheart, she is great with children of all ages.    Pearl is house and crate trained and loves to chew on her Nylabones and Kongs and keeps her chewing to that, other than that she is the perfect house guest, crated or uncrated.    Pearl loves to ride in the car, because she knows she will be with you! She will also joyfully join you for a game of fetch or going for a nice walk in the neighborhood (she is great on a leash). But she's perfectly content lounging on the porch for hours, at your feet as you sip your sweet tea watching the world go by, or just smelling the sweet breeze and listening to the wind.        Pearl gets excited when she meets other dogs and does not introduce herself well in the beginning so slow introductions are a must. She would be best in a home with laid back dogs, although she loves puppies and totally ""mother's"" them. Pearl also needs a home without cats.   This affectionately faithful elegant elder-bull will lovingly spread her pearls of joy through your days!                "

03/19/2016	ANGEL - Brussels Griffon / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Brussels Griffon-Unknown Mix	Boston, MA	Female	Posted Breed: Brussels Griffon / Mixed (medium coat). MEET ANGEL! This little nugget is as sweet as her name! Sadly she came to us from a hoarding situation where she was one of many dogs, and is now ready for a home where she can be the center of attention! While she has lived with other dogs, she can be selective about her friends and doesn''t enjoy dogs getting to close in her face. She can be shy at first with new people and is easily started by sudden movements and loud noises, so she would do best in a low traffic household with older kids and/or adults only, who know how to be around a shy dog. She is a true cuddle-bug and all she needs is a warm couch and someone to snuggle with. She doesn''t really know how to walk on a leash and will need refreshing on house breaking. If you are interested in meeting this sweet girl, please stop by our adoption center today! For more information on ANGEL or any of the other animals currently residing at the Animal Rescue League of Boston, please contact us @ 617-226-5602.

03/19/2016	SNOOPY - Beagle (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle	Ventnor, NJ	Male	Posted Breed: Beagle (short coat). Hi. My name is Snoopy and I am a senior beagle boy that needs to find another person to love me. I am 12 yrs. old, in good health, and weigh about 34 lbs. I lived in a happy home and had a happy life, but when my owner got sick, everything changed for me; my owner was taken away from me and I was taken to a high kill shelter. My chances of getting out of the shelter were not good at all, practically zero. I did not like being at the shelter because it was NOT my home and it was always so noisy there. A good friend and transport person from Maryland called Penny Angels and asked if they could help me. Someone told me that Joan (the kind woman who runs the Rescue) always has a soft spot for older beagles, so I knew that there was still some hope for me. I was very happy when she agreed to make room for me in Rescue. When I met Joan & her husband, Ken, I just kept looking at them and thinking, ‘thank you, thank you for giving me a second chance”! It is so good to be in a home again, but I know that this is only a temporary place until I find my own home. Could your home be my new forever home? I promise to be the best boy you ever had. Please give me a chance!   If you are interested in adopting Snoopy, please fill out an application and submit it to Penny Angels. An adoption application can be obtained by visiting our web site at www.pennyangelsbeaglerescue.com. If you have any questions, please contact beagler534@comcast.net or emnase@aol.com, or call Penny Angels Beagle Rescue at 609-965-9476. Thank you!

Poor Mollie's owner passed away and on the same day she lost her best friend, she found herself in the local shelter. She didn't know what happened but she immediately got depressed and was shutting done mentally. We posted for somebody to step up, to foster this girl, and a very kind couple said they would !!!! We were so happy for Mollie. But Mollie was far from being fixed. She ended getting pneumonia, to which she is currently being treated for. And both ears were very infected. Once we get that infection cleared up, we need to check her heart as she was diagnosed with a grade 4 heart murmur AND 2 partial ruptured ACL's. But Mollie is such a doll. She is doing great in her foster home and loves to have people around her. She gets along with kids and other dogs and LOVES to snuggle and just hang with you. We will update more as more tests are done.  She is spayed and current on all vaccines. Is heartworm negative and micro chipped.

Send inquiries to mchen.pawsne@gmail.comAre you looking for a senior companion to share your heart and home with? Then Miss Bellflower is your lady! Miss B has a special message for you: Hi!! I’m Miss Wiggle Butt, I mean Miss Bellflower and I’m looking for a quiet home to share my love and spend my golden years. Here are some important things you should know about me. 1. I’m looking for a low key home and preferably one with a fenced in yard. I love to sunbath outside and breathe in the fresh air. I could do this for hours on end.2. I may be labeled as a “senior” but I do not act my age. Everyone always assume I’m a pup because of my youthful energy. I’m really the best of both worlds-- I still have pep in my step and also content just being a lazy butt. Don’t worry if you have to go to work, I’m happy to adjust to your schedule.3. “Stranger”? What's that? I love love love humans; my tail goes a mile a minute when I see you. Favorite activities include snuggling, napping, and loving people of all ages and sizes. When you walk through the door, I welcome you with a little tap dance.4. The groomers and vet always give me an A+ for good behavior. 5. Humans think I might be a “pocket pittie,” whatever that is. My pictures make me look huge, but I’m actually on the small side.6. I’ve lived with dogs before of all shapes and sizes, but I really prefer to be your one and only. Playful dogs are too rambunctious for me. I am a proper southern lady after all.7. I’m a pretty darn perfect fur companion—calm, house and crate trained, know sit and wait, gentle taking food, and don’t chew on anything. Sometimes I’m so quiet, my foster mom doesn’t even notice me snoozing away under a blanket on the couch or in the backseat of the car.

03/19/2016	Bailey - Miniature Pinscher / Italian Greyhound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Italian Greyhound-Miniature Pinscher Mix	Grandview, MO	Male	Posted Breed: Miniature Pinscher / Italian Greyhound / Mixed (short coat). Bailey is a loving dog who likes to cuddle in your lap, play and run outside, and go on walks. He is very well behaved and can be trusted to stay in the house whilehe is by himself. He enjoys sleeping in bed at night and sometimes snuggling under the covers. Bailey has visited other homes with dogs and done alright, but he has always been the only cat or dog living in our household. Therefore, I am unsure of how he would do in a family with other pets. He is about 12 years old and weighs 25 pounds. Veterinarians have guessed that he has some Italian Grey Hound, Terrier, or Miniature Pinscher.  We truly wish the best place for Bailey was in our own home. However, when ourchild began to crawl, Bailey became agressive toward her. He nipped her in the face and we can not risk her safety, but still want Bailey to be happy. Bailey deserves a home where he can be loved without being separated or isolated because of children. We truly hope there is a loving home for Bailey where he can be a complete part of the family.

03/19/2016	Samantha Schneagle - Schnauzer / Beagle / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle-Unknown Mix	Pacific Grove, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Schnauzer / Beagle / Mixed. Meet Samantha! She is a 10-year-old, 18-pound Schneagle. That's right... She's a Schnauzer/Beagle mix! Isn't she adorable? Samantha is incredibly sweet and has a wonderful, quiet personality. She is house-trained, crate-trained and even walks great on a leash. When she meets new dogs while she's out and about, she's fairly indifferent toward them. So while she may not be playful she does fine with other dogs. We don't know how she would be with a kitty, but it's possible she'd be indifferent toward them as well. Samantha was a family dog and has experience living with gentle children. She does fine when she is left home alone and sleeps quietly in her dog bed at night. Samantha was surrendered to POMDR because the infant in her family has pet allergies. She has been a loved dog but her family had to make the difficult decision to re-home her.

She lived in a home for 8 years until her owner married and had a child. Rose does not do well with kids under the age of 16. She has been in foster care for the past 2 years and should be placed in a home where she is the only dog or she is the only female dog. Rosie is very obedient on leash and can be brought anywhere. She is the best in the car, at the vet, boarding and grooming. She loves to sprint around the yard while rolling around in dirt and sunbathing. She can sleep in or wake up early. Some people are surprised to learn she is 11 years old. Rosie's foster would keep her but unfortunately she still has not clicked with their personal female dog. They have tried everything. Rosie comes with free training and is located in either Summit or Clinton, NJ. Her fosters work and live in both areas and are willing to meet anywhere. Oh, and her favorite thing in the whole world is to get belly rubs!!! If you are looking for a GREAT companion, Rosie is the girl for you.

03/19/2016	Bonnie III - Australian Shepherd / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Australian Shepherd-Unknown Mix	Dallas, TX	Female	Posted Breed: Australian Shepherd / Mixed. Bonnie is a 25 pound ball of love, as sweet as can be. Her fur is so soft that it's hard not to cuddle with her all day. She loves walks, bones, treats, cuddling, and especially laying by your feet no matter what you are doing.   Bonnie is house trained and knows how to sit. She walks well on a leash and doesn't pull at all. She gets along well with her two foster fur siblings, but sometimes she gets spooked if they come up to her on her right side. Her right eye was removed so she is always winking at you. Bonnie is a true lady, crossing her legs when she is laying down. She would probably be best as an only dog so she can have all of your attention and not get spooked with siblings wanting to play on her blind side.

03/19/2016	LUCY - Beagle (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle	Ogden, UT	Female	Posted Breed: Beagle (medium coat). LucyHi! The Weber County Shelter staff named me Lucy. My puppies and I have been at the Weber County Animal Shelter since 02/23/16. Although my puppies aren''t ready for their forever homes yet; the staff says that I am, and can''t wait! I am an approximate 7-year-old, spayed female, tricolor Beagle, and weigh 32 pounds. I am a little larger than the average Beagle, but nonetheless not too big of a dog. I am a sweet, well-behaved girl that walks well on the leash and is house trained. When you see me in person, you''ll get to feel my beautiful soft, wavy fur. I also might `talk` to you, too. I have the cutest little howl, but don''t use it very often. I get along with the other dogs in the shelter and when I went into the cat room, I did not bark or lunge after them at all. Since I am on the smaller side, I would get along with children of all ages as long as they are respectful. Don''t let my age fool you; the average life span of my breed is 12 to 15 years; so I am only middle aged at this time and I still have a fair amount of energy. It would be best that I go to a home that has at least a medium-sized, securely fenced yard because I like being outside checking out all there is to smell.My $40 adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, rabies, microchip, leash, collar and goodie bag!

Trinity was rescued in Early February and her recovery has been remarkable. Trinity has no major health issues, she just had several minor issues all at once that needed attention. Trinity is 10 years young and came to us very overweight, but she is working on getting that bikini body back (just takes a little longer when we get older). She also had an ear infection and skin allergies, but this was due to lack of vet attention. Since shes been to our vet, her skin and ears have healed amazingly. Her bloodwork is perfect, and she will be getting a dental cleaning in just a few days. Nothing like a little TLC! Now, on to the important stuff...Trinity is love, she is loyalty, she is appreciation. She is perfectly behaved, house trained, crate trained, and has never made a sound in the month we have had her.

03/19/2016	Snowball - Bichon Frise / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Bichon Frise-Unknown Mix	Fairport, NY	Male	Posted Breed: Bichon Frise / Mixed. Not very often do you get a dog whose age in years is more than his weight in pounds. Come meet Snowball, a 13 year old Bichon Frise/mix, who weighs 12.9 pounds. He lost his home due to a &quot;no pet&quot; policy. Snowball has been receiving lots of care from the vets and clinic here at Lollypop Farm, and now he is ready to find that retirement home, where he can be king of his castle. Snowball can be a bit shy at first but if you go slow, he warms right up. He trots along beautifully on his walk, does his business, and then off he goes! He can also be startled by sudden movements. Snowball is a big lover of hot dog bits and soft treats, but the crunchy ones were a bit too much for his teeth. Lollypop Farm suggests children be 14 or older and Snowball must meet all who share your home, dogs included. The Behavior staff have been working with Snowball on several issues, so his new owners will need to speak with one of them. We want this sweet dog to continue making progress and the staff can point the way and give you help. Snowball is also available in the Seniors-for-Seniors program. Approved adopters, aged 60 or older, can bring him home at no fee.

A Short Story: There once was a fluffy, white dog who was very afraid of the thunder storm. He paced and panted, but even his mom could not comfort him. It was clear, no one would be sleeping. He barked and ran over to his foster sister (Hazel.) As soon as she saw how upset he was, she walked over to his bed and sat down. The fluffy, white dog followed, curled up beside her, the the two slept together through the rest of the thunder storm. Hazel is one of the sweetest, most gentle Boxers to come in to rescue.ÿ If you?re looking for a best friend who will shower you with limitless love and loyalty, and keep her family safe from thunder storms, apply now to meet Hazel! 10/20/15ÿ?ÿThe beautiful Hazel is available! She is such a special girl and truly is an angel, hence the inspiration for her Halloween costume!ÿÿShe is great friends with dogs sized big to small and really enjoys their nap time together!ÿHazel may have chronic skin and allergy issues for the rest of her life and may have to be put on an oral medication, if needed, in the future. Her future fur-ever family will need to continue her skin care and dietary needs ? quite a fair trade for the most loving and loyal best friend! 10/7/15ÿ?ÿHazel?s foster mom says that she is the most darling foster they have ever had! She is a fun little 9 year old girl who has discovered the joys of toys! She loves to go through the toy box and pick new ones out to take her bed and play with! She is very gentle and courteous with her tiny foster siblings (3 tiny chihuahuas and a lhasa apso) and even shares her bed with them for nap time! Now with some helpful meds and a healthy diet, her skin and coat have greatly improved as well! She is starting to regain that soft boxer fur and her skin issues are much improved. Hazel makes friends everywhere she goes! She made immediate friends with the neighbors and is a favorite at the bank and Starbucks drive thru?s! Since she has to remain calm in indoors while going through HW treatment, she loves to go on car rides with her foster mom. She even has some golden retriever friends her age that stop over the occasional visit and nap. Once she is medically cleared, this special girl will make the very best and loyal family member. She is kind and gentle but ready to play when she is finally rid of these pesky heartworms! She gives the gentlest of kisses and sweetest boxer hugs. Everyone who meets Hazel falls in love with her! 9/19/15 ?ÿHazel is the sweetest gal of all time! She just moved to a foster home where she can be in the comforts of her own new bed during heartworm treatment. She ignores the little dogs in the house and pays no attention to the cat she sees from the window. Hazel is a very petite girl who wants to be loved?.and she has plenty of love to give back! Hazel will be available for adoption as soon as she finishes heartworm treatment. 8/26/15ÿ?ÿCan you handle all this sweetness? I have pep in my step and love in my heart. Please consider fostering or adopting me! I do have some of those nasty heartworms but should be able to start my treatments soon. I would really like a home to heal in.

I''m an approximate 7-year-old, spayed female, Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix, and weigh 30 pounds. I am a shy gal; it takes a few minutes for me to warm up to you because I am on the timid side. Once we''re friends, I am a really sweet, gentle gal that loves to go for walks. I would make an excellent companion dog, and appear to be housebroken.A side note about my age; the lifespan of my breed is typically 12 to 14 years, so I am only middle-age right now. Just perfect for someone who would prefer a mature dog over a puppy that has to be trained in obedience and housebroken. I still have a lot of spunk, and would do well on any walk or hike if that is something you like to do. My adoption fee is only $40, which includes my microchip, up-to-date vaccinations, rabies, leash, collar, and goodie bag!Please stop by and see me - I''d love to come home with you!

03/19/2016	Bella - Papillon / Poodle (Miniature) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Papillon	Pleasant Hill, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Papillon / Poodle (Miniature). Bella the Papipoo! Bella is a darling little girl who's looking for a great home like yours. Originally bought from a breeder, Bella has lived her life with a wonderful family, but as they're moving out of the country soon and cannot take her with them, this gentle little girl is looking for a new family to call her own. Bella is a mellow girl who loves to go for walks or relax on the back of the sofa while you curl up with a good TV show. Born on March 5, 2006, Bella is spayed and current on her vaccines. She's fully housebroken and does well with other mellow dogs. While she's always been good with kids, she'd be great in an adult household or one with teens as she can guard her food bowl. A free spirit, she's been known to follow her nose when off leash and so needs a securely fenced yard and to be walked on leash when out of the home. If you're looking to add an easy-going, darling, affectionate little girl to your life, Bella's a great choice! Location: Re-Homing Assistance Program Please note that Bella is a courtesy post through CCHS's Re-Homing Assistance Program and has not been met or evaluated by CCHS. Once an adoption application has been submitted, it will be sent to Bella's current owner for review and potential adoption. Thank you!                
03/19/2016	Princess - Siberian Husky / Red Heeler / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Siberian Husky-Unknown Mix	Whitewright, TX	Female	"Posted Breed: Siberian Husky / Red Heeler / Mixed (medium coat). Princess is a spry senior who isn't very demanding. She likes having a place on the sofa, and enjoys a little head-scratch, but she isn't demanding, expecting you to pet her non-stop any time you're near. She likes to sleep on the rug next to the bed, but if another dog claims that spot, she is happy to move back to the sofa. Princess gets along with the other dogs in her foster home, ranging from a 7 LB Yorkie to a 100+ LB Great Pyrenees. If one of the younger dogs doesn't show good manners and gets a little too rambunctious, she will issue a little bark to get their attention, sort of like your 1st grade teacher telling you to play nice. She has apparently never been properly house-trained, and we're working on that. But since she's not a young girl, she will need an adopter who is patient enough to work with her to help her break old, bad potty habits. Princess was surrendered to Dallas Animal Services by an ""owner"" who said she is 15 years old. We didn't have the opportunity to talk to that person, so we don't know whether that was just a guess on their part, but we are pretty darn sure Princess is NOT 15 years old. Her eyes are clear -- no cataracts or ""clouds"". Her teeth are in pretty good shape. She doesn't move slowly as though she has arthritis or joint pain. In short, she acts like a middle-aged dog. If we had never heard any estimate of her age, we would probably list her as 6 - 8 years old TOPS. Maybe the owner was just making a guess. Maybe she's 8 - 10 years old. Or maybe Princess really IS 15 years old and is just in amazingly great shape. We can't say for sure, so we're listing her as a senior just to be on the safe side. Princess has not been tested with cats, but the one time she saw one of our feral cats race across the yard, she gave chase, so she probably needs a home with no cats. She visited our chicken yard and seemed mildly interested, but was easily called away when she started to follow a hen into the chicken coop. So if you keep backyard chickens, Princess could probably be taught to leave them alone. As a senior, Princess has a reduced adoption fee of only $100. Our process starts with an application, which you can find on our website at www.bluebonnetrescue.org.                "

03/19/2016	Daisy Spaniel - Brittany (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Brittany	New York, NY	Female	Posted Breed: Brittany (long coat). Daisy is a Brittany Spaniel from Georgia. Sadly, she was without a home until Rescue Dogs Rock NYC stepped up to take her into our rescue. She was found in someone's garage after wandering in there and was walking into the walls. Sadly, no one claimed her, so we made her a member of our family. Daisy currently fosters in a home with children and is people friendly. The vet feels she is between 11 and 13 yrs of age, and approximately 40 pounds. They also feel that she can see a little, not a lot, which is why she was walking into the walls. This senior girl really needs an angel to help her journey through the rest of her life! If you are this angel, please apply here!

I came to BTRET of Florida after being surrendered by my owners who could no longer care for me. I'm 10 years old but you wouldn't know it by looking at my handsome face.  My  foster  family has two kids and another Boston Terrier and I couldn't be happier. I get along with everyone!  I'm neutered, up to date on my shots, and HW negative.

I walk well on a leash but need breaks during longer walks. I'm also working on being reminded of basic commands because I'm a little out of practice but I'm learning so quick.

03/19/2016	Cricket - Chinese Crested-Hairless Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Greenville, SC	Female	Posted Breed: Chinese Crested-Hairless. Cricket is a very sweet 9 year old looking for a home where she can receive lots of one on one attention. She is a well mannered gal who doesnt realize her age and loves to play with soft stuffed toys. And would like a forever home where she can cuddle up each night with her human. Cricket is, however, afraid of children.Cricket can be very reserved and scared with new transitions. It took her a week in her foster home of being afraid and running from us before she saw we were nice people. After that it was like a light switch went off and she cant get enough of us now. She wants to be with her human 24/7. So a home where she left a lot is not ideal. Cricket enjoys other dogs but does not always like to share her toys or a lap and can be sassy with them. She is hoping for a home that does not have a large amount of pets to share attention with. Cricket currently sleeps in a crate at night. She however, will run and hide underneath the bed to avoid going in her crate. She also will run to avoid having to go outside but will once you put her out. Cricket is very well mannered as far as potty training goes and has only had one accident since being in foster care. Baths and grooming are not a favorite for Cricket.We do not have cats in the foster home but we do have a baby goat. At first Cricket would just chase her and chase her. So we weren't sure if Cricket was playing or wanted to harm her. We corrected her each time she gave chase and in a few days she was laying with the goat and checking on her just like the other dogs in the home do. So that may give some indication of what Cricket would be like with a cat or a rabbit, etc. Cricket is being foster in BLacksburg VA. Please consider transportation as Cricket is not a candidate for air travel.                
03/19/2016	Esther - Labrador Retriever / Border Collie / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Borador	Austin, TX	Female	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Border Collie / Mixed. Esther has lived quite the exciting life so far. So exciting, she wants nothing more than to settle down with some quiet, loving people who will understand her. She's still got plenty of spunk, but can maybe do with slightly less adventuring.    Esther was living on the streets for at least three years as a sort of community dog at a local college. She was fed, but roamed free, until she was brought into Austin Animal Center. Esther really, really hated the shelter environment. It was the complete opposite of what she had gotten used to in every way, and whenever she got the opportunity, she bolted. She is quite an accomplished escape artist.   Fast forward to life in foster, and Esther is getting used to life as a house pet. She is currently living with five other dogs, and after the pecking order was established, she gets along great with them. She is working on crate and leash training. She does need to be in the crate when left alone, and before opening the door to strangers. And she needs a very assured walker, as her first instinct when encountering something she is not comfortable with is to take off. However, she is getting the hang of the give-and-take relationship expected of a pet. She wants to please, and she gives you a very cute puzzled expression when she is not sure what you are getting at. The more time she spends in a home, the more she seems to like it. We think a steady routine and stable environment will do wonders for her.    We think a good home for Esther is a place where someone is home most of the time, and can help her get adjusted to domestic life. Before her free roaming days, she did live in a home, so she seems fully housebroken and she's good at communicating her needs. Despite her skills at wriggling out of leashes, and tendency to dash for any open door, she's really pretty chill. She spends most of her time inside lying quietly by her people, accepting all pets and cuddles. She doesn't bother cats at all, does well playing with other dogs (after a careful introduction) and is good with older kids. We haven't observed her with little ones. She is shy around strangers but opens up given some time.   All in all, this being a house pet thing is not so bad for Esther. Preferable to being a street dog, for sure. The one thing she really, really does not want is to go back to the shelter. If someone can give her the time and assurance that she has finally landed in her forever home, we think she will blossom into a great pet. She wants to be one. Can you give her the chance?

03/19/2016	Brandy *great with kids* - Beagle (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle	Forest, VA	Female	Posted Breed: Beagle (short coat). Brandy is just an absolute love. She is an easy going, lovable middle aged dog . She has gained a bit of weight in foster care, but is on weight management food :) she does well on a leash, loves kids, and is just a great ole girl. We estimate her age between 7-9. She is an ideal dog for a family who would love to have a fuzzy companion around but doesnt have the time to deal with chewing puppy stages or all the hassles that come with an energetic youngster. she is simply affectionate and great company.  She is great with other dogs and cats also! Her adoption fee is $75 please consider giving a senior a home and YOUR last name!!       Brandy's around 7-9 years old and her adoption fee is 75 which covers the following: spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm testing, dhp/p, rabies, bordatella (agre appropriate vaccines), deworming, and all the care he received while with CVRR. All animals are on flea and tick and parasite prevention for the duration in fostercare. We are an volunteer group, who process the applications so please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks, follow-up questions.  You can expedite the process by providing accurate phone and email addresses for all your references. Time to make phone calls is limited and we often have multiple applications in process .  We make every effort to move through them as quickly as possible. When your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if the dog picks you too. If it seems that the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee and an adoption contract to be signed. The adoption fees help cover a portion of the care provided to the animals. All dogs and pups are microchipped and all animals adopted out are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. **All of our animals have a lifetime commitment. If for any reason, the adoption does not work out, the cats and dogs are to come back to CVRR, which is a NO kill rescue.*** The foster family and the rescue volunteers will choose the new home based on the best fit for the dog/cat.

03/19/2016	Aero - Boxer / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer-Unknown Mix	Hillsdale, IN	Male	"Posted Breed: Boxer / Mixed (short coat). Aero was brought to the shelter by Good Samaritans and local law enforcement. He was found in emaciated condition on someone's porch. The homeowner claimed he was a stray, so law enforcement brought the dog to the shelter for care. Aero is about 10 years old and weighs 43 lbs. He would be a healthy weight at about 60 lbs or more. He has been treated for a heavy load of intestinal parasites and is on a high protein diet to gain weight. He is heartworm positive and the shelter has not determined if he will be treated due to health and age. Once he is a good weight and cleared by a veterinarian, a decision will be made about treatment. Aero is very loving with people and ignores other animals. When able, the shelter would love to place him in a foster or adoptive home to be spoiled for his golden days. He hasn't had such an easy life and deserves to know how happy a dog's life can be! If you would like to help Aero but aren't able to bring him into your home, please donate towards his care--and others with medical needs in the shelter--by going to Aero's gofundme page! We are grateful for any and all help towards their medical needs. Contact the shelter for questions or details! Unless otherwise stated, the adoption fee for dogs over 4 months is $120.00. Puppies under 4 months are $140.00 The adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, microchip, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians.

03/19/2016	Casey Spitz - Spitz / Chow Chow / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chow Chow-Unknown Mix	Pacific Grove, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Spitz / Chow Chow / Mixed. Casey is an incredibly sweet 10-year-old, 35-pound Spitz/Chow mix who loves to cuddle on the couch and hang out around the house. She is very easy to walk on leash, knows all her commands, and loves to shake hands. She is loyal and loving. She loves to go on car rides, short hikes, and just be around people. She is in excellent health. She would thrive in a home where she can live out her golden years in a quiet, peaceful environment, where she does not have to worry about too much energy around her. Casey is fine with other dogs of all sizes, although she can be a little shy. She needs to go to a home without cats. Casey is fine being left home alone while you run errands and prefers to sleep near her person at night. Casey came to POMDR when the living situation in her previous home became too stressful for her. To no fault of her own, her guardians have young children and the energy level that comes along with that just doesn't work for Casey. She was their beloved dog for ten years and they had to make the hard decision to let her find a new home. She is already doing fabulous in her new foster home where things are calmer. She is a very good girl.                
03/19/2016	JoJo - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Durham Region, ON	Female	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed. With her pert fox like features and full ginger and cream coat, gentle JoJo resembles a large plushy toy. Sadly, the sweet and slightly plump (she’s on a weight loss program) doggy apple of her adoring owner’s eye is being taken into our care due to his failing health. A loving and affectionate companion to him, that’s how JoJo is with those she calls family. Loyal and intelligent, she knows commands such as sit, stay and jump, walks well on leash (although she prefers walking less now and relaxing more), and rides easily in the car. When left on her own during the day, this well-mannered miss roams freely through the house and sleeps where she chooses at night. JoJo’s one “nono” is her tendency to charge at cars on her walks, although she’s better than she was. Leery of strangers until introduced to them, she does not get along with other dogs (cats are questionable), and would do best as the only pet in a home with no children, preferably one with a fenced yard to sit and stroll in with those she loves.  Please note that the animals in our program are available for adoption only to individuals located in the Region of Durham area; however we are always happy to refer you to a rescue or shelter in your area. Thank you for your understanding.                
03/19/2016	NY/Ruger - Brittany (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Brittany	Curwensville, PA	Male	"Posted Breed: Brittany (medium coat). Ruger is an 8 year old liver and white Brittany who is neutered, current on vaccines and very sweet. He is heartworm negative and on preventative. He is a playful, social, happy boy who likes to play with toys and other dogs. At night Ruger sleeps in a dog bed in his foster parents' room. Generally he is quiet, is very gentle, will whine and go to the door when he wants to be let out and uses the dog doors independently. Chewing a bone is a favorite activity when he is not exploring the yard. Ruger is very good at playing ball and will bring the ball to you so you can throw it again for him. He comes to his name, knows basic commands, loves to go for a walk and enjoys being with people. Despite all his excellent qualities, Ruger needs a very special family to adopt him because he has an issue that developed 3 years ago. Neurological symptom of mild weakness in his hind legs was observed and his gait was a little wobbly, like a newborn colt. Ruger is able to get around where ever he wants to go without any difficulty. He jumps on and off the bed, furniture, in and out of the car, uses stairs, runs and climbs without any help. Because of the loss of some sensation in his hind quarters, Ruger will ""drop"" a nugget of poop at times and not be aware of it. If he does realize he has done this, he is very ashamed and is waiting to be severely chastised for it. When he realizes he will not get into trouble for this, he gets the biggest smile of relief on his sad face!  When Ruger came to his foster home, a complete exam was done by the vet to check for causes of his neurological symptoms and reported frequent dribbling of urine. Ruger was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and since taking antibiotics he has not had any issues with incontinence or dribbling. Discussion on a cause for the symptoms yielded 2 possibilities, but neither was diagnosed when the symptoms appeared. He is healthy overall, has a history of ear infections reported and allows all grooming done without any protest or struggle. If you would like to know more about Ruger and are interested in adopting him, please visit www.NBRAN.org to complete an adoption application and then contact your state or provincial coordinator. The fee to adopt Ruger is $200.00 to offset his vetting and to allow NBRAN to rescue more Britts in need. Transportation may be arranged up to 1,200 miles with the adopter being responsible for the last 100 miles.                "

Rocky will be 9 years old this August with a lot of love left to give. He is a quiet guy that loves a sunbeam to lay in. He is fine with other dogs and will still get a playful streak in him once in awhile with his human. When he sees us in the morning, his long little body starts to twist and the tail just wags. He is missing some teeth and has a bit of gray on the face but still lets you know when someone new is coming to the house with his spunky little self. He has a good temperament with adults, and we would recommend him for a quiet, adult home as he is a bit old to deal with children. He is crate trained and is not a yappy boy. Rocky boy is neutered, heartworm negative and current on shots, heartworm and flea prevention. If you are interested in adopting, please submit an application at www.richardsonrescue.org. For questions, please email screscuepets@aol.com.                
03/19/2016	Benny Bruce - Boston Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boston Terrier	Ocala, FL	Male	"Posted Breed: Boston Terrier (short coat). My name is Bennie. I came to BTRET of Florida after being surrendered by my owners who could no longer care for me. I'm 10 years old but you wouldn't know it by looking at my handsome face.  My  foster  family has two kids and another Boston Terrier and I couldn't be happier. I get along with everyone!  I'm neutered, up to date on my shots, and HW negative. I'm also perfectly house trained. I'm a little overweight right now but my  foster  mom has me on a diet and I'm already seeing results of eating well and regular walks. I walk well on a leash but need breaks during longer walks. I'm also working on being reminded of basic commands because I'm a little out of practice but I'm learning so quick. My favorite toy is tennis balls. I don't really like chasing them but I really enjoy laying down and chewing on one for awhile.  If you're looking to add a new member to your family, please consider meeting me! My adoption fee is $200.  Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee (BTRET), Florida Division does not have a shelter or facility. The dogs are in private foster homes throughout the state of Florida.   If you want additional information on me, please send an e-mail to christyg59@hotmail.com and someone will get back with you shortly.   The process always begins with an application which can be found at www.bostonterriertn.org.  Note that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., ""under 6,"" as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety.    Additional Info. for Heartworm Positive Dogs:  BTR of East TN has embraced the ""slow kill"" Heartworm treatment method for all HW+ dogs because it's much easier on the dog although it can take a little longer in some cases. You need to make sure your vet will continue to provide you with Heartgard and support this treatment before adoption. You should also know that post adoption should you opt to use Immiticide you do so at your own risk and could endanger the life of your dog. We are available to discuss why. Bonus for adopters - free 30-day health insurance with each adoption: The 30-day coverage plan ensures the pets you adopt out are covered for accidents and illnesses. This plan provides $1,000 aggregate/ $500 per-incident limit of accident and illness protection. It reimburses 100% of vet bills after a $50 per-incident deductible. Adopters have the option to extend or upgrade their coverage at the time of activation. There is no cost to the adopter for this 30-day protection.                "
03/19/2016	Rocko Saint - Boston Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boston Terrier	Lake Mary, FL	Male	Posted Breed: Boston Terrier. My name is Rocko Saint. My owners surrendered me because they worked too much and like most people, I just couldn’t hold it all day! However, I am housebroken and will scratch at the door when I want out. I will also bark to let you know I want back in. I’m not a huge fan of the outdoors. I prefer to be inside curled up in my bed, or stretched out in the sun somewhere. I don’t jump, or bark much, or get up on furniture (even though my foster mom said it was okay). I would do best with someone who is home to let me out frequently. Like most old guys, I have some special needs. I am blind in one eye and don’t hear too well, but I am a very sweet boy and will follow you everywhere. I like all dogs big and small, cats, and children. Rocko is 13 years old and weighs 29 pounds. If you are interested in adopting Rocko please visit our website at www.btrfl.org to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application.If you are interested in adopting, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application. www.btrfl.org Because we have Boston Terriers of all ages, we have a sliding scale for adoption fees generally ranging from $200 to $550 based on the age and health of the dog. Our fees cover vetting costs, shelter fees, fuel for transport, copying and printing of contracts and paperwork, our website presence, food, boarding, behavioral training and additional medical care. While the dog you adopt may not require all of these things, many other dogs in our system do. By adopting from Boston Terrier Rescue of Florida, you are not saving just one life, you are helping to save others as well.                
03/19/2016	Matt - FOHA - American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Fredericksburg, VA	Male	"Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). I’m a senior ""boy"" named Matt but I still have a boyish disposition. I have been at FOHA, well, how long is forever? It has been a long time. Five years at least. I came to FOHA when a little girl rescued me after I was chained outside for 6 years. I was in foster for a time, but my foster dad had to move because of the rough economic times. Back to FOHA for me where I have been ever since. While I have a nice cottage in the long-term Village with a comfy love seat, I secretly long to spend my twilight years in a loving home, getting the attention I thrive on. When I was in foster care, I enjoyed long naps, lounging around the house, and taking daily walks. I love people of all ages, from wee little babies to senior citiziens. Other dogs and cats? Not so much. Since I was chained during my formative years, I never had the opportunity to be ""social"".  I promise if you take me home, I will greet you with a smiling face and a wagging tail when you walk through the door. I like soft, cuddly blankets and beds to rest on and a safe place to hide during thunder storms. Boy do I hate those storms. I shake all over. I like being brushed and getting a good belly rub. I’m already housetrained and very well-behaved. I am available to be adopted or permanently fostered. Come and meet me. You won't be disappointed.

03/19/2016	EMMA - Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Belleville, MI	Female	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). Emma is that odd looking girl in the corner who most folks just overlook. She's got that goofy, gargoyle-like terrier face going for her and some pretty deep brindle color, both of which make the average person just a little wary. But the reality is that Emma is a sweet girl who will make a great dog for someone who will give her a chance. She's one of our favorites and we want to see her find her forever home.  She's a tiny girl but don't let that fool you - she can jump, bound and run with the best of them. We're thinking she might even give a greyhound a run for its money, not to mention a kangaroo when it comes to hopping and jumping! No unsupervised time in the yard for this girl, unless you've got some seriously high fences! She's also got the funniest wiggle that is usually prompted by your arrival or your voice. She also enjoys car rides and a good walk.  Emma is great with obedience and is a perfect girl in her crate. Emma did a spectactular job at our Train-a-Bull workshop displaying some of her most stellar behavior, even in the company of ten plus dogs! Yay Emma! She is definitely a bit bossy and uneasy with other dogs so we'd really love to see her be the only dog in the home she goes to so that she can finally get the TLC and 1-on-1 time that she so deserves.

03/19/2016	Rosie II - American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Fredericksburg, VA	Female	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). Rosie is a great little gal who loves everyone she meets; she lives by the motto that humans were meant for snuggling and kissing! In the house, Rosie is very playful for about 20 minutes and then is ready for a nap. Preferrably with you, but she's not too picky!  Rosie doesn't mind riding in the car, going to the vet, or getting baths. She did seem a little too interested in chasing a farm cat who ran from her, so she may do better in a home without kitties. She also would do best in a home without small children; she loves stuffed animals and doesn't always want to give them up. Because of this, she would also be best as an only dog or with a laid back dog who is okay with Rosie having all the stuffies.    History:    Rosie was adopted from Bully Paws as a puppy at 14 weeks old. We thought she had found her happily ever after; we saw Rosie around the community with her new family as she grew into a well-behaved young girl. The family also adopted another dog from another local group. Unfortunately, the happily ever after did not last forever for these two pups.   In September of 2013, we received a phone call from an animal shelter in Florida. Rosie and her adopted buddy were turned in as strays. Her buddy was suffering from skin issues. Luckily, Rosie's microchip led the shelter back to Bully Paws. We frantically attempted to reach her adoptive home, sure they were heartbroken and searching for their little girl and her friend. After what seemed like an endless search, we discovered the adoptive family was actually the same family who surrendered Rosie and her friend to the shelter, lying and claiming both were strays. The county they were surrendered to did not adopt out stray pit bulls. The only hope for these dogs was to get them from Florida back to Virginia. Two of our dedicated volunteers hopped in their cars and drove several very long days to get these dogs back to safety.     Rosie is now in a foster home and doing great. She is house trained, crate trained and healthy. We can't say what has happened to her in the past four years, but she is adapting to life in her foster home and is ready for her true happily FOREVER after to come along.

I am a very happy go lucky dog who loves, well, everything, it seems.

I also love my foster parents but I am searching for a forever home; a place I can settle in with my sister Sadie. The vet says I am an overall healthy dog, especially for my age.

I’m also crate trained. And leash trained too…but obviously I haven’t done much in the way of walks lately. But I can! And I want to! I’m good with other dogs and get along just fine. I just need a home with some patience and a little love. A lot of love! I want someone to say, ‘You, with the sad eyes’. ‘I’m going to click the ‘Adopt’ tab, complete my adoption application and put you, Nikky, as a dog of interest’.

03/19/2016	Happy Gilmore KY - Boston Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boston Terrier	Maryville, TN	Male	"Posted Breed: Boston Terrier (short coat). To talk to foster, please look directly below for the specific foster's contact information.  WE DO NOT HAVE A SHELTER FACILITY WHERE APPLICANTS CAN MEET OUR BT's PRIOR TO INITIATING THE ADOPTION PROCESS. Each are lovingly cared for in our network of private foster homes until the perfect forever home can be found for them. Keep in mind that we prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog, over-the-road transports are done typically on a case by case basis.  We can occasionally help with transport, if there is someone traveling your direction.  PLEASE NOTE THAT AFTER MARCH 1, 2014, WE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO ACCEPT APPLICATIONS FROM NY, CT, RI, MA, VT AND NH    Happy Gilmore is truly a well named dog- just look at his smiling face! Happy is a 9 year old purebred male Boston Terrier, weighing in at 22lbs! We don’t know that much about him prior to coming in to rescue, but although he has cloudy eyes, he can still see some.   What we do know about Happy is that he loves lots of things. He loves car rides, tummy rubs, ear scratches, dog chew treats, fuzzy blankets, warm sun rays to nap in, and people to give him attention.   Happy can get along with other dogs, but younger dogs make him a little nervous- probably because they move around a lot and he can’t see that well to keep track of them. So he would do best in a home with older or less active dogs. Happy has three cats in his foster home and pays them no attention. He also has two children in his foster home, and he is rather fond of them.   Happy is a barkoholic when he can’t see his people but can hear them, and he likes to be where the action is. He will also bark to let you know that there is too much action, and that it is making him nervous.    Happy is crate trained and does not mind the crate, especially if there are treats in there and warm, fuzzy blankets.    Although Happy is an older gentleman, he still has lots of life and love to share. He is silly and fun, ready for adventures and trips, and ready for a brand new life with a forever family! Happy needs to have eye drops every day to help keep his eyes from getting much worse, but he is so happy, he doesn't even mind getting them!    DOG FRIENDLY-YES, best with older dogs CAT FRIENDLY-YES KID FRIENDLY- YES, no small children due to vision issues CRATE TRAINED-YES HOUSEBROKEN-YES     The adoption fee is $225.00. If you want to talk about me, please contact my foster family at the Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee, Kentucky Region Email me at: BTRETky@gmail.com and a foster momma or daddy will get back with you as soon as possible. Keep in mind this is the general mailbox for the entire KY Region.Please use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions and we suggest that you contact the foster to check how many applications might be in front of you. The process always begins with an application which can be found at  The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website Note that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., ""under 6,"" as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma. Also, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.

Misty is a female miniature poodle, about 8 years old.

After 3 hours of surgery, a good bath and clipping, she is on the road to recovery. One of our board members thinks her name should be Trooper -- because she is a tough little survivor, and in spite of it all she has a very sweet, vivacious personality.

I do enjoy a walk – and I’m good on a leash – but mostly, I’m fine to just hang around quietly with you! With my age, I’d like to be in a quiet, all-adult home. It would be an added bonus if my owners were around during the day. I like company…did I say that already? I like other dogs and get along just fine. I have some arthritis so I won’t be doing a lot of playing, but I like the company of my four-legged friends too! I’m crate trained and I’m house trained too. I’m hoping for a home that matches my easy-going, friendly and compatible personality.

My name is Majic and I am a super sweet male beagle from New Jersey that would love to bring some magic back into your life! I recently found my way to Penny Angels because my family had to move to a place where dogs were not allowed. That was definitely a bummer, but I didn’t have any say in the matter. Now, I am on a quest to find my new home. I am 11 years old and would like to live out the remainder of my years in a forever home where I will be gently smothered with love. At my age, I don’t think that is too much for me to ask.   I weigh about 24 lbs. and have a small and stocky frame. I recently had a dental exam and I am in good health, though I do have a slight heart murmur that doesn’t appear to affect me in any way. I am crate trained and seem to get along okay with children and other dogs. I enjoy spending time outside in the yard, especially on nice, sunny days! Ahh, to feel the warmth of the sun on my body… that is one of the simple pleasures in life! It definitely doesn’t take much to make me happy. I love everyone that I meet and would be a wonderful & loyal doggie friend to add to your family! What are you waiting for?! I will be at Petsmart on Saturday if you are interested in meeting me. If you already feel a connection to me, please consider filling out an application and submitting it to Penny Angels TODAY.

Bonded pair! Must stay together with BubbaMeet MAMA! She is part of a bonded pair and needs to be adopted with ZZ-Bubba! Mama is a chubby, lovable older lady who just wants a warm, safe place to call home. She is spayed, up to date on shots and micro chipped! She is housebroken and may walk a little chaotic on the leash due to Mama's poor vision, and Bubba (her son who she must stay with) trying to be right next to her. Mama has chronic dry eye and is on daily eye ointment along with an herbal supplement that helps with inflammation (and fixed her shaky back legs!). She's approx. 12 years and her eyesight is poor, but she gets around just fine with her nose and Bubba. All she wants is to have her belly rubbed and cover your with kisses, then she'll happily sleep all day. *courtesy post-contact Vylet Randolph at 714-829-0262 or by email randolphvylet@yahoo.com You can see more pics of them on my IG @vyletmint Thank you so very much.

Bonded with ZZ-Mama. Must stay togetherMeet BUBBA! He is part of a bonded pair and must be adopted with ZZ-Mama Bubba is 10, and acts like he's so much younger. He is housebroken, up to date on shots and is micro chipped! Bubba is a loving, gentle older guy who is looking for a warm, safe place to call home. He is also leash trained and walks can be a little chaotic on the leash due to Mama's (his mom whom he needs to stay with) poor vision, and Bubba trying to be right next to her.d He has arthritis in his back hips and takes daily oral Metacam for it. He will tap-tap-tap you to get your attention and wants his ears rubbed or his chest scratched. He's playful for his age, and can entice Mama into a wrestling match if she's up to it. He does suffer from anxiety induced seizures at every bet visit, but Valium can be offered before to calm him. Vet visits are the only time this happens to him. He's a pug/Tibetan/Papillion mix (we're guessing). Please give Bubba and Mama and forever home to enjoy their golden years together in! *courtesy post-contact Vylet Randolph at 714-829-0262 or by email randolphvylet@yahoo.com You can see more pics of them on my IG @vyletmint Thank you so very much.

Now could be the perfect time to become a Foster Care Guardian and open your home and your heart. Rosie supplies veterinarian care which includes vaccinations, de-worming and de-fleaing as well as well as spaying and neutering. Rosie also supplies collar, leash, good quality dog food and cage.

03/19/2016	Kansas - Maltese (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Maltese	Grandview, MO	Female	Posted Breed: Maltese (medium coat). Hi, my name is Kansas! I was a rescue when my mom found me. She drove all the way from Arkansas to Kansas City for me! Since then the rescue closed. I used to be shy and skittish but I learned how to play and trust people. I think I am over 10 years old but nobody really knows. You wouldn't think it though when I'm feeling good! I like to play with small plush toys. I can shake them and pull them but my favorite is to roll on my back and try to get it! I love kids and other dogs! Sometimes my guardian gets upset when I try to play with her 2 year old by grabbing onto her little socks. I guess they aren't toys so I play with her by rolling on the floor with her. I enjoy playing with my dog mates too! I also like to randomly bark when I hear the neighbor dogs bark. I have a funny raspy bark. I think my vocal cords were partially clipped before I was rescued. :( Another favorite thing to do is to lay in laps! I love to snuggle and be pet!  My mom passed away a few weeks ago and my guardian is unable to keep me. While my mom was sick, I don't think she was able to see that I was hurting too. I developed a fungal or bacterial infection in my paws. Antibiotics helped but it came back and I don't think my guardian has the time to really control it. She has 2 other dogs, a small child and another on the way.  My paws are inflamed and itchy and they hurt when I walk on rough surfaces. It's hard to go up and down stairs so sometimes I do my business on the porch when I am let out. :( I don't mean to, it's just easier. I do need a lot of attention right now but once my paws are better, I won't need as much. It's best to have my paws trimmed to see the inflamed areas. My paws need frequent Epsom salt/apple cider vinegar soaks and anti-itch sprays per day. Again this should go down when my paws get healthy. I also take medication for allergies and my thyroid as well. This is supposed to help so I don't get future infections.  This may seem like a lot, but I know I will make a family very happy. I hope for the day you choose to snuggle with me. I am looking for a family that has a heart for healing and open arms to accept my needs.    For more information, please contact my guardian, Jamie at 814-504-2383 and leave a message or email her at jaminabone@gmail.com

Adoption Donation   $  350               Located: in Long Island NY          Age: 10 years young         Weight: 20 lbs          Very sweet girl, good with kids, cats and dogs!  What a sweetheart! Missy Ann is a darling, easy going little girl who gets along with everyone she meets. At age 10 she was given up by the only family she'd ever known when her owner faced eviction. Her owners dropped her at a shelter and described her glowingly but little Missy didn't come in particularly good condition--she was terribly matted and her ears were black from infection and dirt. > But this little lady certainly cleans up well! Missy is now comfortable, healthy and enjoying life in her new foster home. She is passive with the other dogs and follows her foster mom around, tail wagging. She loves to sit next to you on the sofa and rest her head on your lap. She likes to be carried. > Missy Ann only barks when the other dogs bark. She appears to be housebroken as long as she goes out regularly. She likes to take walks and her favorite pastime is a snooze in the crate with the door open. Missy loves treats and bones. She is probably a few pounds overweight but we are working on that. > Missy Ann will make a wonderful companion.

Pet Information CONTACT: UHA ADOPTION COORDINATOR MEENA AT 626-841-9030 OR EMAIL AT meena@hope4animals.org. PLEASE CALL OR EMAIL. DO NOT TEXT.  Description: A4924959 Norman is a confident, bright-eyed 8-year-old black-and-white male Chihuahua who was surrendered, along with his brother Niles [A4924962], to the Baldwin Park Animal Care Center on March 3rd because his owner had passed away. Weighing 11 lbs, Norman is a self-assured, loving boy who watches out for his brother. He came out of his kennel easily, trusting the handler; and he showed her how good he is on leash, how alert he is to direction, and just, well, how grounded he is. He likes to sit on laps, too, and he’s a great kisser. He and Niles are bonded, so we’d love to see them go to their forever home together; but if that’s not possible, we think they’ll do okay leaving the shelter separately. We see Norman as an easy-fit inside pet and companion for any individual or family who’s looking for a superb TV-watching, walking, and hanging-out companion.

Description: A4924962 Niles is a cuddle-loving 8-year-old tan-and-white male Chihuahua who was surrendered, along with his brother Norman [A4924959], to the Baldwin Park Animal Care Center on March 3rd because his owner had passed away. Weighing 8 lbs, Niles is a bashful guy, depending on his brother for cues and direction on how to behave. He’s okay on leash, which may be because of the noisy, chaotic surroundings in the shelter; but if you pick him up in your arms, he’s visibly happier and relieved. He does gain confidence from being with his brother (they’re definitely bonded), but we think he’d blossom if his forever home is separate from Norman’s. Niles will do best as an indoor pet and companion with an individual or family (whose kids, if any, are respectful of his tiny size) who’ll make him feel secure and build up his canine ego!

03/19/2016	Lennier (aka Lenny) - Rat Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rat Terrier-Unknown Mix	Wakefield, RI	Male	"Posted Breed: Rat Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Age: 14 Years Weight: 15 lbs    This dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.     STOP! Please don't pass by me just because I'm a senior! Hi, my name is Lennier, but my friends call me Lenny. I'm a Rat Terrier mix around 14 years young, yes at 14 I'm no spring chicken but I'm still young at heart! Puppies may be fun, but they are not for everyone, as they are a lot of work! They have a lot of energy, and with their razor sharp teeth they may use a chair leg or your foot to teethe on, and let's not bring up about what they do to rugs! That may be fine for some, but for others, puppies just don't fit in their lives, whereas seniors like myself still play and have fun, and will sit by our humans, but we are not high energy and not needy. Dogs my age are - ""what you see is what you get,"" I am full grown, so there are no worries of me suddenly turning into a extra-large sized breed dog. I would be great for a human senior looking for companionship in their golden years. I am crate trained and house trained but being a new place, I may need a little direction to where I need to potty. I love people, kids and other dogs, but I am not sure about cats. I love to be petted, I'm good in the car, and don't need training. My foster home has a fenced in yard, so they open the door for me and I go out; because of this, they haven't had me on a leash, but since I'm so well behaved they think I will be fine with one. A fenced in yard at my new home would be great, as I love it outside for short periods of time, but if not, that's okay too. My foster mom says I am very easy to take care of, I was an emotional support dog for my last owner, but unfortunately she developed asthma and couldn't keep me. My last family taught me that going on the furniture was naughty, so when my foster mom puts me up on the couch or bed I jump off and sit by her feet. I like to go to bed at 9:00 pm and I sleep all through the night, and wake up at 7:00 am. I love yummy treats and do you know what make me the happiest dog in the world? Sitting with people that love me! I take heart medication daily for a heart murmur, it's nothing serious, but if you need more information about it you can email my people. Thank you for taking the time out to read about me. I hope my fur-ever person is out there and reads this, as the saying goes...""Saving One Dog Will Not Save The World, But Surely For That Dog, The World Will Change Forever.""   If you would like to give a senior a home and endless love, please fill out an application, I hope to hear from you soon! Adoption Fee: $170   To apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/   **Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

03/19/2016	Bella - Dachshund (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund	Haliburton, ON	Female	Posted Breed: Dachshund (short coat). CDR is a volunteer driven organization dedicated to saving and rehoming abandoned, neglected, and unwanted dachshund and dachshund mixes.       Founded in 2001, CDR was created in response to the overwhelming number of dachshunds desperately needing to be rescued.    To date CDR has saved the lives of over 900 wieners from abuse or euthanasia.   CDR volunteers encompass a vast network of dedicated individuals, spanning the province of Ontario. This far-reaching group strives to ensure that no dachshund in Ontario is left behind.   CDR works closely with local, national and international animal welfare organizations, to provide care for wieners who are in distress, suffering abuse, abandoned or homeless.Name(s): BellaAge: 8 years oldSize (weight): 5.4 kg/12 lbsCoat & colour: Red with cream frostingTemperament: Sweet, but nervous and insecureGood with Dogs: SometimesGood with Cats: High prey driveGood with Kids: UnknownHousetraining: Not reliably housebrokenSuitable for an Apartment: Can be quite vocalOrigin: Owner surrenderAdoption Fee: $300.00 And now a few words from me: I there! I’m Bella, a pretty red short-haired girl with cream frosting. Due to recent changes in my life I’m feeling quite insecure, and sometimes I have a lot to say to people and other dogs, preferring to bark first and figure things out later. I really like going for walks and while I don’t have the best leash manners, I don’t mind the leash, so let’s think of it as a work in progress. I love running around the yard without a leash – it’s so much fun! Sometimes my foster mom takes me to her friend’s house, and she has a really nice fenced yard where I can play and run. I hope my forever family has a nice big fenced yard too, because although I’m small, I need and want good exercise every day. I’m looking for a home that will make me feel safe and loved, and will teach me manners so that I can be a wonderful canine companion. And now a few words from my foster family: Bella is a sweet, cuddly wee girl. She is quite nervous and unsure of how to relate to people. She means no harm, but she doesn’t seem to have an understanding of how to be a good canine companion. In some ways, she is like a grown-up puppy. She appears to enjoy playing, but is not always sure how to do it. Cultivating a couple of favourite games would be a real relationship builder. Bella’s new person or family must be committed to working with her in a kind and consistent manner, and an obedience class would be a great way to learn together and cement a positive relationship. In her foster home, we are working on “heel”, “sit”, and “off”. She’s a great girl, and in the right family she will be able to gain confidence and reach her full potential.We do not have a shelter, all dogs are fostered in homes all over Ontario. We do not adopt outside of Ontario. You must be 21 to apply.

03/19/2016	Colonel Wheelie - Dachshund (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund	Salt Lake City, UT	Male	Posted Breed: Dachshund (short coat). i everyone, I’m Colonel Wheelie. I am a (almost) 5 year old, male Dachshund. There is one very important thing you should know about me from the very beginning… It could be a deal-breaker so I like to get it out there in the open before you fall too deep in love… I bark at new people. Whew, I’m glad I got that off my chest. Oh also, I can’t use my back legs. It doesn’t make my foster mom love me any less, but it is something we live with together. I have recently experienced paralysis of my hind legs. I can no longer use those pesky back legs and I now need help going potty. It makes life a bit harder, but on the upside, I get to ride in a sweet wheelchair sometimes! I get around the house just fine without my cart so it’s not necessary a lot of times. I use my front legs to get me where I need to go. They are little legs, but they are mighty! It would be best to find a family that has someone home more often than not. I go for walks in my cart but I do tire out more quickly than other dogs. I really love being outside. I like to roll around in the grass and explore my surroundings. I need help going potty but it’s easy to do. I’ll teach you. I get along well with other dogs but will need to be sure I don’t get stepped on. Not only am I little, but I am a low-rider. I’m one of the shortest dogs west of the Mississippi. I am a spunky guy and cuddles are my favorite. If I could have it my way, I would be lounging outside or in your arms all day. I have a lot of love to give and I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to care for me each day. I am kennel trained but it wouldn’t be best to be alone in a kennel for long periods of time, as I begin to stress. I fall in love quickly and just need someone with patience, time, arms to hold me and willingness to learn a few new things about my care. If you are looking for a special needs pup that is way more than special, apply for my adoption at  rescuerovers.org . Love, Colonel Wheelie.

03/19/2016	Leon - Chihuahua / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chihuahua-Unknown Mix	Old Fort , NC	Male	Posted Breed: Chihuahua / Mixed (short coat). We will be happy to answer any questions you may have on our adoptable pets, but please remember that the first step in adopting an animal from us is to fill out an adoption application.  Meet Leon an 8 year old Chihuahua. He is a super sweet, sometimes grumpy little old man. He loves to cuddle in his foster mom's lap and sleep next to her. He gets along great with the other dogs and cats in his foster home. He likes to take car rides. He is crate trained and house trained. He would do best in a family with no small children.   His adoption fee is $65.00.   All known information about our dogs is listed under notes. We do not know how big a puppy will grow to be in adulthood. Please research the particular breed to see if this pet may be a good choice as a new member of your family.       Your first step in adopting a new family member is to fill out the free online adoption application. The adoption form must be filled out completely with phone numbers and a vet reference before it will be processed. Your application will not be processed without this information.      We sometimes receive many applications on one dog. Our goal is to place the dog in the best home possible based on his/her needs, personality and past history. Please note that adoptions are NOT done on a first come, first serve basis, and filling out an application does not guarantee the adoption of any dog. We reserve the right to refuse any applicant for inaccurate or false information. We are looking for the best possible home for this animal. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.

Chase is a 10 year old Parsons type broken-coated tri coloured Jack Russell terrier. He is 15 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 26.5 pounds.

Chase is a happy, affectionate, friendly Jack who loves to play ball. He is well-socialized, walks well on leash and is house trained and house safe. He rides well in the car. This is a super nice dog who would fit in well in any terrier-friendly home - either as an only or as a second or third dog. Chase did have some skin issues when Mr. O. first adopted him from another rescue, and he will need to stay on a grain-free diet. But that is true of most terriers. Chase is located in the Eugene-Springfield area. His adoption fee is $100.

For four years you are living in a warm and cozy house with your family and then they get the news that they are being evicted.

This boy is very nervous, but once he is out of the kennel environment he is super swee t! Toby lived with another dog, cats, and rabbits.

03/19/2016	Halo - Dachshund (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund	Los Angeles, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Dachshund (short coat). My name is Halo and my big brother is Deannie. My foster Mom rescued us from doggy jail where we were taken when my owner became too sick to care for us.  Even though she found us in a strange environment on a cold cement pad, I was brave enough to give her kisses through the fence and she fell in love immediately. She rescued us  within 48 hours  of our confinement.  Although my mom isn’t sure, she thinks we could be biological brothers and that we have probably lived together for all our lives (I have told her the whole story, but she needs a little work on her doggie “English”)  I am a handsome 10 year-old red short-hair with a few dapple markings and weigh approx. 10LB.  Deannie is a 12yr old light red short-hair, weighing about 12.5 lb (my mom says he is handsome also—however I am sure I am the best looking between the two of us).  My foster mom considered adopting us and taking us to Nebraska.  We do get along with other dogs, however we are very protective of our toys and she has an even older (wow!?!) partially blind dachshund who we may be a little too rambunctious to be left unsupervised with (in her large yard).  We would like to be adopted together, but would probably be ok if our new home has another dog to be friends with.  Also, we don’t do well with birds—we think they are food.  We are kennel trained and walk well on a leash and enjoy playing with our toys. We are up-to-date on all our vaccinations, have microchips, and will bring our kennel, blankets, collars, and leashes with us. We love to snuggle and sleep in the big bed with our human’s at night, but also know how to sleep in the kennel. Halo  PS:  While I am happy to let my brother tell you our story, I want to add my thoughts… as I don’t think Halo even notices that I sometimes walk a little differently than he does and that steps are especially not good for me . I have a very cute bunny hop when I get a little tired, but I am exercising and getting stronger every day. My foster mom thinks that I may have had an lower back disc injury at some time in my life.  I can walk up or off of a street curb without difficulty but mom avoids all other steps.  I have good urine and bowel control as long as I am allowed potty breaks at 6-8 hour intervals during the day.  I am a little shyer than Halo and take a little more time to trust my humans, but now my foster mom knows that I give great kisses and love to have my neck and nose rubbed after my trust is earned.  Overall we are very young “seniors” and can’t wait to show our love to our new “forever” humans

03/19/2016	Odie - Dachshund (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund	Haliburton, ON	Male	Posted Breed: Dachshund (long coat). CDR is a volunteer driven organization dedicated to saving and rehoming abandoned, neglected, and unwanted dachshund and dachshund mixes.       Founded in 2001, CDR was created in response to the overwhelming number of dachshunds desperately needing to be rescued.    To date CDR has saved the lives of over 900 wieners from abuse or euthanasia.   CDR volunteers encompass a vast network of dedicated individuals, spanning the province of Ontario. This far-reaching group strives to ensure that no dachshund in Ontario is left behind.   CDR works closely with local, national and international animal welfare organizations, to provide care for wieners who are in distress, suffering abuse, abandoned or homeless.Name(s): OdieAge: 8 years old (date of birth: Jan 18, 2008)Size (weight): 9.68 kgCoat & colour: Soft reddish beigeTemperament: Gentle nature, wants to be near his peopleGood with Dogs: YesGood with Cats: YesGood with Kids: YesHousetraining: Generally good with occasional markingSuitable for an Apartment: NoOrigin: Owner SurrenderAdoption Fee: $300.00 And now a few words from me: Here I am in my brand new foster home with three other canine playmates! They seem to like me as much as I am enjoying them, and I am happy to share my toys and mealtime with them. I love going out to run around in the back yard. I also really enjoy my walks and it’s fun meeting new people with their kids and dogs along the way. In my previous home, I got along fine with the kids there and had no trouble with cats. I am looking forward to meeting my forever family – could it be yours? And now a few words from my foster family: Odie is an easy dog who likes company, especially that of his humans. He is quite content with whatever is on offer: walks, car rides, and outdoor exploration with his foster brothers. Odie will spend an hour or two in his crate without complaint, but after that, he does bark to be let out. He can also be quite vocal about unexplained noises, so would not suit apartment living. He is a pleasure to take on a walk and greets whomever he meets politely. Odie would make an excellent pet for a family that will appreciate his gentle, affectionate and easy-going nature, and who will be present for him most of the time.We do not have a shelter, all dogs are fostered in homes all over Ontario. We do not adopt outside of Ontario. You must be 21 to apply.                
03/19/2016	Chewy - Shih Tzu Dog For Adoption	rescue	Shih Tzu	Salt Lake City, UT	Male	Posted Breed: Shih Tzu. Chewy is a darling shih tzu looking for a quiet, adult family home, who will be home most of the time to give him love, care and attention. Chewy is a quiet, sweet, very well behaved and happy little boy, with lots of tail wags. He loves to follow and be with his foster mom where ever she is around the house, other than that, he is not real active. He likes choosing one of the comfy dog beds to snuggle in most the day.  Chewy is house trained, though he needs the opportunity to go out often to avoid accidents. A secure, fenced yard is a must for Chewy. He wants his foster mom to go out and be with him when he goes out to the bathroom. When he's finished, he will come right back in with her. He should never be left outside in the yard alone since things in the yard can irritate his eyes. Chewy is fine with the sr. cat and other small dogs at his foster mom's who don't bother him since he is very shy. Chewy gets very excited about his special food he eats for breakfast and dinner, prances around and can hardly wait for his food bowl to be put down. Chewy has special eye drops that must be put in his eyes once a day to continue to keep both of his eyes healthy for the rest of his life. His eyes may need to be occasionally wiped carefully with a clean, warm, wet wash cloth to keep the area clear and clean. Since Chewy is a shih tzu, a regular grooming schedule is a must, with the hair kept trimmed away from his eyes.The Vet noticed that Chewy's heart has an extra beat and that his heart beats a little slower, so he should not do any strenuous or high activity. Chewy is neutered, healthy, happy, chipped and up to date on all of his shots and is ready for his loving, forever, perfect, adult home.

03/19/2016	Alish - Maltese / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Maltese-Unknown Mix	Apple Valley, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Maltese / Mixed (short coat). Estimated DOB 12/03. If you get excited about helping a neglected shelter dog transform to a wonderful companion, then Alish is the dog for you! Alish has a big and silly personality and has demonstrated that she thrives with love and attention. Alish gets along well with other dogs and gentle children and enjoys cuddles, naps in the sun and playing with squeaky toys. She also takes her bully sticks very seriously and will chew on them for hours at a time.  When we pulled Alish from the euthanasia list at the Orange County Animal Shelter she was listless, bloated, unable to walk and was missing most of her hair. After extensive veterinary testing, it was determined that Alish has Cushing Disease. She is now on one medication a day, in the morning, which she takes like a trooper with a little lunch meat! Likely this medication will be needed for her lifetime. Since feeling better Alish is able to walk normally with complete confidence. Alish’s stomach bloating is down and her hair is filling in, although she will need more time for her coat to fill in completely.  Please visit www.nostrayleftbehind.com to see our schedule for adoption events and to fill out our application. All adoptions require an application and home visit.

I'm a sweet and adorable older guy who is young at heart! I like being carried and held in your lap and I love to snuggle up and under blankets.

I have good potty habits on a schedule, and keep my crate clean. I do make a little initial noise in my crate, but I settle into pretty quickly. I had a bit of hair loss and skin issues when I was rescued, but I'm healing up nicely and my hair is coming in really well.

Tiny Ruby was abandoned by her owner in a crowded, rural shelter in Virginia. She was very afraid so despite her adorable face, she was overlooked by adopters and was in danger of spending her last days in the pound. But some wonderful volunteers reached out to Good Old Tails, and Ruby was sent to Pennsylvania to live in a home again and look for a family who will love her forever.  Ruby is still very shy but responds well to quiet voices and treats. She is quiet and calm, and likes laying in soft beds or exploring the yard. Due to her size and age, Ruby will not be placed in a home with young children.

03/19/2016	Chico Trenton - Chihuahua (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chihuahua	Rockaway, NJ	Male	Posted Breed: Chihuahua (short coat). * PLEASE DONATE to help EHR with Chico's continuous care * This sweet little old dog was rescued by one of our volunteers from a life outside in a yard in NJ. Eleventh Hour Rescue first heard of Chico when a friend of the owner's family begged us to help him. The owner was bringing him to a shelter because, at 10+ years old, he had never had any vetting & she couldn't bear to watch him grow old. A wonderful EHR foster stepped up to take Chico into her care, hoping that with some medical attention & time, he would be able to find a forever home. But 10+ years of absolutely no medical care had taken it's toll on Chico - he was found to suffer from multiple chronic medical conditions including Diabetes, Cushing's Disease and a growth on his throat. Eleventh Hour Rescue is providing all the necessary medical care Chico requires and his bills are costly. Please donate and help us continue to care for this elderly little dog so he may live out his home in comfort, surrounded by love for the first time in his life. Chico is thriving in his foster home but continues to have complications from his medical issues, so your donations are desperately needed. Help us give him the comfort and care he so richly deserves but never experienced until recently. Thank you for supporting EHR & Chico - we will make sure he never is neglected again.                
03/19/2016	Brady - Cairn Terrier / Pug / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Pugairn	Potomac, MD	Male	"Posted Breed: Cairn Terrier / Pug / Mixed (medium coat). COURTESY POSTINGBrady is a healthy terrier, pug, Chihuahua mix, about 13 pounds and in excellent shape. His face is white with black nose and mouth so it looks like he is always smiling! Brady will be about 10 years old in September, 2016. We got him fromPetConnectRescue, and at that time the vet said he was about 2 years old. He had been with a family with five children under age seven and totally traumatized. Prior to that he'd been found in a hole on a big farm somewhere in this area. His teeth had been filed down so they thought perhaps he was chewing on the cage trying to get out. His teeth are sensitive to cold water, but room temperature is fine. Brady is up to date on all shots and meds, acts like a puppy but doesn't hear well now. I have to clap to get his attention and a dog whistle would likely work I just haven't bought one. He is house and leash trained and needs to be on a leash when taken outside. He is fine in an enclosed area, but goes ""hunting"" if not leashed in the open He's calm when approached gently, but is a little skittish (the Chihuahua in him). Like most dogs, after you feed him a few times he falls in love...He's very loyal and protective of his owner; a ""one woman man"" LOL, or ""one person man"". He's not a lap dog, but will sit next to you, touching. He loves to bark out the window at passing deer, and squirrels but not at the doorbell. \         contact me directly at 301-332-2963.

To talk to foster, please look directly below for the specific foster's contact information.  WE DO NOT HAVE A SHELTER FACILITY WHERE APPLICANTS CAN MEET OUR BT's PRIOR TO INITIATING THE ADOPTION PROCESS. Each are lovingly cared for in our network of private foster homes until the perfect forever home can be found for them. Keep in mind that we prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog, over-the-road transports are done typically on a case by case basis.  We can occasionally help with transport, if there is someone traveling your direction.  PLEASE NOTE THAT AFTER MARCH 1, 2014, WE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO ACCEPT APPLICATIONS FROM NY, CT, RI, MA, VT AND NH     A little about Myra! She is the sweetest little girl, that is about 10 years old and still wants to play, but will sleep her day away if you let her. She is current on vaccinations, spayed, heartworm negative, and microchipped. Myra is great with all dogs, ignores cats, loves respectful children and car rides! Myra walks great on her leash and is crate trained but would much rather be with her family being held or at least in a soft doggie bed close by. She's not a barker at all, but verbally communicates her needs with a gentle whine. She does this when she wants to go potty or wants food/water. She's totally house trained unless she has to much water or her outside time isn't long enough. Please consider Myra and remember... Senior dogs are so deserving of a home to spend their golden years in. Myra has no problem seeing from her little blue eye. She hears well and has so very much life and love left to give. Myra is being fostered in the NW Georgia area, near Atlanta, so please plan to meet and adopt near her foster home as she's not available for transport. We prefer homes with current pet history and Boston experience is a plus. No homes with large dogs or children under 6 years old. The adoption fee will be $250.00 If you want to meet me, please contact my buddy Tammy at Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee, by email at: btretnrescue@gmail.com NOTE: Submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.Please use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions and we suggest that you contact the foster to check how many applications might be in front of you. The process always begins with an application which can be found at  The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website Note that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., ""under 6,"" as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma. Also, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.

He has also not been around cats.Toby has done very well with my granddaughter (he snuggled in and took a nap with her) however he LOVES to have all the attention.

He is also more interested in people than in toys. Toby is kennel trained, is UTD on his shots, and eats twice a day. If you are looking for some companionship, he is your guy!

03/19/2016	Abby Rose - Pekingese (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Pekingese	Oakdale, TN	Female	Posted Breed: Pekingese (medium coat). Abby Rose is a darling little blond girl who came into rescue recently. She has a heart murmur, and more concerning,, she also has some congestive heart failure issues. She's on meds and is doing well, and has the kind of attitude that makes you quite sure there's nothing wrong with this dog!!  She's the smallest one in the bunch,,, and likely the pushiest!! If there's something she wants, she doesn't care who got there first.... Oh, yes,,, and that's in spite of the fact that she's blind!! Vision isn't a big deal to dogs............. We take in dogs like this with the assumption that they may very well spend their last days with us. And that's perfectly okay. But sometimes there are folks out there who understand the awesomeness of these little old timers and are willing to provide them a home for their last months or years... so we post Abby Rose just in case one of those people might see her picture and bio and decide she'd make a wonderful addition to their family.

Looking for a Bright Future!Precious was born about March 5, 2008 and weighs about 15 lbs. She could stand to drop a few and that should happen easily once she understands how to play and what zoomies are! She was recently released from a life of pumping out puppies for pet store shelves spending her entire life in a small cage, with a wire bottom, in a puppy mill!!!! She is looking forward to a bright future in a real home with a real family to love her. She is wonderful with other dogs and another ""normal"" dog would be to her benefit to show her what life is all about. Precious so wants to be loved and give love but she doesn't know how yet. Her tail wags non-stop but when you reach to pet her, off she goes. Patience will need to be had with Precious to show her that humans can be kind. She is not potty trained and this is done no different than you would a puppy, we recommend using a crate and have many tips on www.joyfulrescues.org about working with mill dogs. She has no idea how to walk on leash yet and truly would benefit from having a safely fenced yard. Just imagine what it is like for this girl to feel snow and grass on her tiny, little, pads. She is starting to get the hang of nylabones and you may catch her looking at you with one sticking out of her mouth like a cigar. She didn't know what to do with it, but knew she liked it! She needs time, patience and kindness and we do suggest using floor potty pads for mill dogs as they learn to ""hold it"" and often these small dogs benefit from floor pads throughout life since their bladders are just smaller in proportion than larger dogs. She is a happy dog, just needs to learn how to be a dog and not a money making machine. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $275.00. Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.    Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.

03/19/2016	*Romano Cheese - Poodle (Toy) / Maltese (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Poodle (Toy)	Pittsburg, CA	Male	"Posted Breed: Poodle (Toy) / Maltese (medium coat). Umbrella of Hope ""Be Our Pet""9 yr old, 4.5 lb Toy Poodle NEUTERED MALE for ADOPTION    They call me Romano... as in the cheese. But I like to think of myself as ""Mr-Cuddlebug-LapBandit-BullyStickKilling-MarshmallowFluffernut"" I hail from CONTRA COSTA ANIMAL SERVICES where I was brought in as a stray and no one came to claim me. I had to have a special neuter because my boy parts were on the inside and I am healing well from that. I also had to have my teeth cleaned too. I am microchipped, vaccinated, free of parasites and have had senior bloodwork. I am around 9 years old and I weigh 4.5 lbs...yes, I am TEENY TINY. The vet says I could stand to gain a 1/2 pound or so, but she does not want me to get fat and HATES it when people adopt dogs and assume we were abused or starved and overfeed us and turn us into circles or ottomans. My health will be better if I stay a good weight. Feeding me proper portions is important and when you are a 5 lb dog, that is actually a very tiny amount. I am likely mostly (if not all) toy poodle but I might have a touch of Maltese in me too. After I go to the groomer on Saturday, I will know a little better. I am quiet and sweet and I love to snuggle. Perhaps my best home ever would be one where I got to sit on a lap all day. I am gentle and I LOOOOOOOVVVVEEEE to chew on bully sticks. So much in fact, that I am insisting that any applicants that want to make the final cut promise to get them for me regularly and stuff (write that down). I am good with other dogs but I couldn't really care less about them. I could also co-exist with cats. I am fine with children, but I am pretty mellow and I would prefer a home where it was more on the quiet side most of the time. I qualify for the Seniors for Seniors promotion, so if you are over 55 we might be a perfect match although I would certainly consider younger parents as well. If you are interested in me, please email beourpet@gmail.com. Due to me being lucky enough to be born this breed and size, they expect me to be somewhat popular, so turn on your charm to convince them you are the bestest ever pick for me (and that I can have lots of bully sticks). #startastoryadopt#shelterpetlove#seniordogsrock#seniorpetsrule#teenytinytoypoodle#romano#bullysticklove#umbrellaofhope     GENERAL INFO:  Housebroken?: Yes, we think so Crate Trained?: Yes Leash Trained?: Yes Rides Well in Car?: Yes Non-Shedding?: Yes Good with cats?: Yes, we think so Good with dogs?: Yes Qualifies for Seniors for Seniors?: Yes Umbrella of Hope does not have any strict rules on ages of children because all children are different, but our best approximation is that this animal would do best with children over the age of 5 Umbrella of Hope is a non-profit animal rescue based out of Pittsburg, CA that rescues animals off death row from local shelters.

03/19/2016	Zsa Zsa - Papillon / Mixed (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Papillon-Unknown Mix	Redmond, WA	Female	"Posted Breed: Papillon / Mixed (long coat). ↵           ↵       NAME: Zsa Zsa       AGE/GENDER: Senior, 2/17/2008        BREED: Papillon       TEMPERAMENT: Zsa Zsa is a super sweet laid back little lady. She is great with new people and is just an overall happy dog.        WEIGHT: Currently she's 11 pounds, but is on a strict weight loss plan to get to a healthy 8 pounds.       HOUSE TRAINING: Working on it!       CRATE TRAINING: Zsa Zsa is fine going in her crate.        OTHER DOGS: Zsa Zsa is great with other small dogs. She attends daycare regularly.       CATS: TBD       CHILDREN: Dog-respectful children, 8 and older       ADOPTION DONATION: $325.00       HEALTH: Zsa Zsa is spay/neutered, microchipped, flea treated, dewormed, and is current on vaccines. Your adoption donation goes toward the cost of this vet care as well as transportation and general care costs. In addition, all pets adopted from Motley Zoo come with 30 days of free pet insurance provided by Shelter Care.         HISTORY: Motley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to find Zsa Zsa a great forever family and that is exactly what we plan to do!         NOTES FROM NAME'S FOSTER HOME:  Zsa Zsa is an adorable, sweet bundle of fur and fun. She is a darling little companion who will follow you anywhere, but who can also entertain herself and be fine too. She is very overweight currently and needs a strict diet and some increased exercise, but she is getting there slowly but surely. She does have a heart murmur which we are currently looking into with an ultrasound to see what, if anything, is to be done. She wil need a dental before she goes, but we must check into the heart first. Zsa Zsa's long locks need grooming approximately every 4-6 weeks, at least a ""sanitary"" groom so her hocks and legs stay clean and clear. Her ears have been trimmed, but you might want to let them grow and flow like papillons are known for. Zsa Zsa is pure bred, initially purchased from a breeder. Her person died and the family came to Motley Zoo to find her the best home. This is what we will do! Zsa Zsa is a great little dog and deserves the best- perhaps this is you?         All dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and either a Martingale collar or a harness, depending on each dog's particular needs.         Welcome to Motley Zoo Animal Rescue. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization that is run entirely by volunteers. Motley Zoo does not have a brick and mortar shelter location. Instead, all our rescue animals are cared for in private foster homes where the animals receive one-on-one care and attention in a home environment until permanent placement is found. Please email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application and we will work toward approving you as an adopter with our rescue so that we can set a time for you to meet!         For more information, please visit www.motleyzoo.org.         Thank you for considering adopting a dog in need!         Woof,         The Motley Zoo Crew                "

I’m warm and dry now and getting plenty to eat. My foster mom and the whole AADR group told me I’m a safe little boy now but it hasn’t always been that way. If I go back and tell you my story, it starts when I was purchased as a wee pup and into a great life with my family and was treasured as their pet. But a year ago my beloved owner died, and my world was turned upside down. I was told that I couldn’t be in the house so I was put in a small crate and lived outside. It was a long time before someone knew this wasn’t right for a little thing like me, and in stepped AADR.  When Sparky arrived at an AADR member's home and his prison door opened, a timid and pitiful little creature emerged. His bones stuck out, his fur was thin and he stepped very carefully. He got a good meal, nice blanket, and then he came over for some love what a sweet, sweet boy he is. Sparky was heading off to the vet the next day where it was learned that he had a narrowing of a disc in his neck which was causing him pain. After some meds and rest, it was known that surgery would be the only way to get Sparky a great life. So into surgery he went, then lots of rest and recovery and much need love. Sparky is now doing great, loves running in the yard, playing with his toys, sleeping in his crate or the big bed. Sparky gets along with all the dogs and cats in his foster home. Now Sparky will bark if someone comes near the house, but isn’t that what we have them for. Sparky showed how smart he is in PetSmart last night, he picked up some new toys for himself, and was happy to say hi and show some love to everyone in the store he met! Sparky will be a great addition to anyone’s Furfamily. Please if you are interested in Sparky please fill out the application!! If you have questions about Sparky, please email his foster mom, Cathy, at Cathyjbm@aol.com or fill out an application online at www.allamericandachshundrescue.org.   If you have questions about this dog please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above. They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal.  We welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo. You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport. If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 Fee added for the required Health Certificate.  We will not adopt into the state of CT, RI or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states. If you have an issue with this you need to take this up with your legislatures. We are now approved to adopt/foster in the state of NH but adopters will have to pay health certificate fee of $45 once to transport the dog to an approved quarantine facility and then a second fee of $50 to get the dog out of quarantine after two days. The quarantine is a New Hampshire requirement for any animal imported into the state. We cannot negotiate or waive these fees as they are expenses to AADR. To understand the adoption process through AADR please visit the Adoption Information. Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3. If you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE. Please don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your ""new friend"" get up and down the East Coast or up and down the West Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well for now please look for dogs on your coast.                "

Hello, everyone! I''m Tucker, an impossibly cute 7-year-old Jack Russell terrier mix. I''m very interested in exploring and sniffing things, so would love to go for nice walks with my new person or people to check out the neighborhood and get to know each other. We''d probably have fun going to Beginners'' Obedience classes together, too! I''ve met some other dogs here at the adoption center and haven''t been too interested in them, so if you already have a canine pal at home, make sure you arrange with the staff for a meet and greet to see if we get along. I''d be happy being your only 4-legged bud too, though! I''ve never lived with cats, so it may be best if I went to a kitty-free home. And I''d do better in a home with older kids who are dog-experienced. I also get stressed when my family isn''t home, and would prefer a home where someone is home with me more often than not. Would you like to have a handsome new 4-legged pal in your life? Then please come by the adoption center to meet me today!

03/19/2016	Reese - Pomeranian (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Pomeranian	Harrisburg, PA	Female	Posted Breed: Pomeranian (medium coat). Reese is a sweet 7-9 year old, 8-pound redhead who was rescued from a horrid life as a breeder in an Amish puppy mill. She is a shy, but a sweet little thing that is showing quick progress to life as a house dog.    Reese is a quiet Pom and needs a family that is familiar with puppy mill demeanors and will give her time to trust humans. As long as she is taken outside every 2-3 hours, she does not have accidents. She does need some work on a leash, so a fenced yard would be ideal. She is okay with being picked up and loves to receive pets and rubs. Reese's teeth were left to rot and she will lose the few she has left during her upcoming dental cleaning. This little love really needs a home where she can learn to be a companion dog and realize the love a warm lap. She looks to other dogs for direction and would do great in a home with older, respectful children.    If you would like to give her the home she's always deserved, please submit an application at http://PawsitivelyPom.rescuegroups.org. Her adoption fee of $250 (reduced to $150 for senior citizens 65+) helps to reimburse for her current vaccines (rabies, distemper/parvo, and bordatella), heartworm, lyme and fecal tests, spay, dental, microchip, and bloodwork.

Buddy had been with his elderly owner since he was a young puppy. He was always walked multiple times a day until his owner passed away. Buddy is adjusting well and getting used to being with other dogs. He seems to like everyone he meets, human and canine, but we don't know about cats. Since Buddy is used to someone being at home with him, a retired person would be an ideal adopter for him. He's crate trained but doesn't like it too much. He's used to sleeping on a rug on the floor so he's pretty easy to accommodate. He's getting his teeth cleaned and is healthy otherwise. Buddy's adoption fee is $200     All of our dogs are in private volunteer foster homes, and as such these individuals are most qualified to answer any questions regarding the dog. We do not have a central shelter or kennel locations - you must make a private one-on-one meet and greet appointment with each individual dog at the foster family's convenience. To protect our foster families' privacy, we must have an APPROVED adoption application on file before we release their contact information.  All of our dogs are fixed (spayed/neutered) and up to date on shots. We have a 2 week foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog is a fit for your family. Adoption fees vary from dog-to-dog.  Please note that an approved application DOES NOT guarantee that the dog will be placed with you.

03/19/2016	Ruby in a foster home - Rat Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rat Terrier-Unknown Mix	Jefferson, LA	Female	Posted Breed: Rat Terrier / Mixed. Ruby is an 8 yr old female rat terrier. She ended up at the shelter because she was biting the owners friends. Since we have been fostering Ruby we have determined that she may have been mistreated and will bite when she feels scared and anxious. However, Ruby has many wonderful qualities: she's affectionate, energetic, dances, very animated, house broken, smart, loyal, and learns very quickly. She also attaches rapidly to those she loves, loves the dog park, and most all she loves her stuffed toys! Ruby would do best with someone that can tell when she is anxious or scared. Also she would do best in a quiet and calm household with no young children.If you are interested in Ruby, please e-mail her foster mom Nicole at nkrohn@bellsouth.netThe Jefferson Parish Animal Shelter adoption fee is $67. Fee includes at least one round of vaccinations, mandatory spay/neuter surgery, heartworm test, and microchip.

03/19/2016	Clarence Oddbody - Bichon Frise / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Bichon Frise-Unknown Mix	Philadelphia, PA	Male	"Posted Breed: Bichon Frise / Mixed (medium coat). Don't be fooled by Clarence Oddbody's age, because he's as spirited and energetic as any dog half his age! When Clarence gets excited or sees new people and animals, he lets them know how ready he is to interact and say hello. Often times he's not sure how to channel this excitement of his, so he barks-- he's got quite a few years of life experience under his belt, so he's got a lot of stories to tell you! He warms up quickly to new people when they take the time to let him sniff and get to know them, but is not really a ""cat person."" Because sometimes he startles easily, we believe he would do better with older children. And at just under twenty pounds, he's sturdy but could easily fit on your lap for cuddles! Did we mention how in love he is with toys? Because he is so very in love with toys. And belly rubs. And back scratches.

Senior sweetie alert....Who are YOU calling a senior? As far as I am concerned, my life has just begun. Up until this point, my life has been less than easy but my foster mom is making up for all that lost time. And good thing because I deserve it! Yep, she says I am sweet, loveable and all around adorable. Personally, I don't like my new haircut but like I said, life before was pretty tough and my long hair was so matted it had to be shaved. But we have both decided we are not going to let that happen again and soon enough it will be silky smooth and I will even have that little swatch of blond hair on my chin that I always felt was my best feature! I may be small but I am large in personality and just waiting to find a family that will treat me like one of their own. I so want that. Please, don't let my age scare you. Little pups like me can live well into our teens with good care and the doctor says I am in pretty good shape. I never wanted anyting more in my life. I hope you think I am worth it because after all I have been through, I am still waiting for my human best friend to find me. Miley is available through a rescue. Applications, home visits and tax-deductible adoption fees are required.

I came from AL where a Brittany rescue saved me from being turned into a shelter along with my sister Truffles. The Brittany rescue got in touch with AADR and they took us in. I am now looking for my forever home. My foster mommy says that I am so precious she cannot understand why someone would want to just throw me away like trash. I am a senior girl and when I was vetted I lost some teeth but this does not affect my eating, I do love my food. I am house broken, leash trained and crate trained what more can a person ask for. I love, love to go on walks with my foster sisters. When foster mommy says walk I get so excited that I start barking and foster mommy starts laughing because she says that I sound just like a little hound dog. I love my quite time either under my blanket or on top of it. I am not a dog that needs to be with other dogs, so if my forever home does not have another dog that is okay. I will just get all the love and attention. If the home has older children to would be great, younger children would scare me. If you are looking for your next best friend please consider adopting me and giving me a home to live out my golden years. I will love you and give lots of doggie kisses. Please contact my foster mommy and she will let you all about me. Just go on line to All American Dachshund Rescue and fill out an app.  If you have questions about this dog please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above. They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal.  We welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo. You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport. If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 Fee added for the required Health Certificate.  We will not adopt into the state of CT, RI or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states. If you have an issue with this you need to take this up with your legislatures. We are now approved to adopt/foster in the state of NH but adopters will have to pay health certificate fee of $45 once to transport the dog to an approved quarantine facility and then a second fee of $50 to get the dog out of quarantine after two days. The quarantine is a New Hampshire requirement for any animal imported into the state. We cannot negotiate or waive these fees as they are expenses to AADR. To understand the adoption process through AADR please visit the Adoption Information. Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3. If you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE. Please don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your ""new friend"" get up and down the East Coast or up and down the West Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well for now please look for dogs on your coast.                "

We make every effort to move through them as quickly as possible. When your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if the dog picks you too. If it seems that the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee and an adoption contract to be signed. The adoption fees help cover a portion of the care provided to the animals. All dogs and pups are microchipped and all animals adopted out are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. **All of our animals have a lifetime commitment. If for any reason, the adoption does not work out, the cats and dogs are to come back to CVRR, which is a NO kill rescue.*** The foster family and the rescue volunteers will choose the new home based on the best fit for the dog/cat.                
03/19/2016	Elvis of DE - American Eskimo Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Eskimo Dog	Randallstown, MD	Male	Posted Breed: American Eskimo Dog (medium coat). Elvis was picked up as a stray right before the really cold spell. He appears to have been neglected or outside for quite awhile. He really needs a very special person or couple to adopt him. He was named Elvis because of his shaking in the crate. He definitely does not like crates. He is a bit hard of hearing, and starles easily because of that. He loves to follow you everywhere. He's mostly housebroke, but can't hold it for a long time. So we are hoping for a home where he won't be alone for many hours. He can wear a belly band though at night or during long times. And maybe a doggie door would work. He's a senior. He would love to find a senior who would love him. He knows seniors who adopt seniors are hero's! Elvis is good on a leash and he loves to take walks. He's a very energentic boy for a senior. He adores playing with stuffed toys. And loves to do zoomies when you come home. He also likes people who visit. He's small for an Eskie, and a beautiful cream color. Easy to pick up! I will update more as I get to know him. For questions, you can email foster mom at katana653@aol.com. Whenever possible Eskie Rescuers United tries to adopt out its dogs locally (or at least to adopters in adjoining states to where I'm being fostered). Please note that ERU processes LOCAL adoption applications before considering those from out of state. If I'm not local to you, as explained above, and you really have your heart set on me, you will have to make special arrangements so ERU can get me to you safely (for example, flying me to you at your own expense, or paying a transport group to drive me to you). Note: We may ask that you to make a donation to cover transport costs if the distance is great and we have trouble finding transport drivers.There is an adoption fee required; and, please be aware, Eskie Rescuers United will not adopt out its dogs as outdoor dogs.    Eskie Rescuers United American Eskimo Dog Rescue, Inc. is an IRS-approved 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Please click the donation button below to make a tax-deductible donation through PayPal and help make a difference to even one American Eskimo dog!                
03/19/2016	Kai - Pomeranian (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Pomeranian	Zionsville, IN	Male	Posted Breed: Pomeranian (long coat). Kai is an 8-10-year-old Pomeranian. This sweet little guy became homeless when his elderly human became unable to care for him. He is hoping now to find another family to call his own! He is sweet as can be, housetrained, and quiet. He isn't one to play too much, but he enjoys low-key companionship with dogs and cats. And of course, he loves to snuggle with his people!  Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label. Each dog in our rescue is in a loving foster home, where they can grow, play, and recover from their time spent on the streets or in a shelter. If you'd like to meet an adoptable dog, please fill out an application on our website, www.edcr.org. Because we are a foster home based rescue a completed adoption application is required to meet our adoptable dogs.                
03/19/2016	Pixie - Pug / Chihuahua / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chug	Vacaville, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Pug / Chihuahua / Mixed (short coat). Adopting A Shelter Dog These dogs come without background histories/ past medical information. We present these dogs as we have observed in relationship to age, size, breed, behavior, housebreaking, crate training, good with children, cats, dogs, and strangers. Dogs may present themselves differently in different environments, therefore The Dog Spot Rescue, their agents, volunteers, can not guarantee behavior, age, size expectations, breed, house Training, destructive behavior tendencies, and/or medical issues. All dogs from shelters have been subjected to pathogens from the shelter level which can materialize into disease in the future. Each adopter must observe for themselves pre-adoption and make decisions for themselves the suitability of said dog and their tolerance levels for transitional time when adopting a shelter dog. We ask that each adopter take their time when making the choice to bring home a rescued dog.Little senior Pug mix needs a retirement home.Owned by a 75 year old woman who went into the hospital but not retrurn, it was discovered that Pixie lived with 29 other dogs. All were seized by Animal Control and shortly there after were scheduled to be euthanzied for space. All were saved by rescue and 15 plus Pixie came to TDS. Pixie is now ready to find that forever home with a senior owner or anyone who will give her the security and love she needs. Quiet, reserved at first, she is a good girl who gets along with all dogs, cats and is safe with children. She is not a dog who will give you instant love but will develop a relationship with you over time. Then you are her world. If you can give her the time she needs, we would love for you to meet her. Adoption is $125.00 which includes her spay, rabies, bordetella, worming treatment, shots. If you would like to meet this sweetheart, please fill out an on line form at thedogspot.rescuegroups.org and then contact us for a meet and greet at: thedogspotreescue@aol.com for a quick response.  Paws crossed. Your Adoption Fee covers the following expenses: Spay/Neuter, DHLPP, Bordatella, Rabies (if age appropriate), De-worming and Frontline/Advantage Please Note: Shelter/rescue dogs have been exposed to many pathogens such as kennel cough, parasites, diseases and conditions some of which may not have been discovered prior to adoption. Any dog that shows symptoms here at TDS are routinely identified, taken for tests and treatment. Our vet bills can exceed $10,000 a month. However, without symptoms, we may miss a disease, or pre-existing condition or parasite. Consider carefully if you have the tolerance for these possibilities. We consider, you, the adopters, the last leg of the rescue process.

Thanks for your interest in Beau. He has an adoption pening but please look at our other awesome dogs.Beauregard is an absolutely adorable Puff boy that loves human contact.  He is fine with the cats, he is polite with the other dogs of all ages and sizes that he meets and he will joyfully walk on leash just to be near his person. Beauregard has just the right amount of energy; he is not a lazy dog but he does not require a lot of play time so if you want a companion that adjusts easily to your daily schedule changes, then Beau just might be the guy that you are looking for.  Beau came to us very matted so his coat had to be clipped down but he is already on his way growing back those beautiful locks. Either with a full coat or something a bit shorter, Beau is as cute as he can be.  We would like to see Beau go to a home where he has companionship of his people most of the time. He really dpesn't like to be alone and since he's already paid his dues in life, we think he deserves all the love and attention he can get.

03/19/2016	Olaf - Maltese / Chinese Crested-Powder Puff / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Maltese-Unknown Mix	Greenville, SC	Male	Posted Breed: Maltese / Chinese Crested-Powder Puff / Mixed. Meet Olaf. He is a 9-pound little Maltese/Chinese Crested mix that is sweet as he can be. He's fluffy, cuddly, and loving. He has not been with his foster family very long but he has settled in quickly. When he was introduced to the other dogs in the home, he just stood there patiently, wagging his little tail while they all surrounded him to sniff him. He is nine years old, but still acts quite young for his age. Will still flop on his back and scoot across the couch and will also grab a toy to play with. He gets very excited when it is time to eat and runs straight for his bowl. He loves laying on the couch and just snuggling up under a blanket. He is going to be a great companion dog for a lucky adopter.When I ask him if he has to go potty he will go outside. He has to go out more frequently than some of my younger dogs so probably would do best in a home where the owner is home or not gone all day. Due to his age, he also qualifies for the Golden Opportunity Program, which matches older dogs with households ages 62+.Olaf is being fostered in Yorktown, Virginia.

03/19/2016	Pammy Buchanan - Dachshund (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund	Friendswood, TX	Female	Posted Breed: Dachshund (short coat). I was dumped  in a dumpster. Then the shelter saved me from that awful fate. The shelter reached out to DRoH and   NOW  I am safe and sound and loved with Dachshund Rescue of Houston. I have bit of a journey to full health, but in the meantime I will let everyone get to know my sweet and gentle personality. Follow my story and get to know me too!! Hi y'all! I am new here at DRoH. And I am ever so glad to be a DRoH girl. I used to be known as the the Dumpster Dachshund -- someone tossed me in a dumpster like yesterday's trash. I don't know how that happened, so my story will be begin with the day that Animal Control contacted DRoH and I am became a DRoH girl!  I got my teeth cleaned (and boy, did they need to be!) and now I am getting ready to get rid of the pesky heart worms that have infected me. Gosh, y'all -- just one pill a month can prevent this. I do know somewhere in my past I was a much loved girl. I have very nice house manners - I LOVE everyone - men, women and other dogs. My favorite thing? I love sitting in laps. LOVE the lap. LOVE it.  I am re-learning my potty skills and so far, so good. I prefer to be with my foster mom, so sometimes I bark when she leaves the room. But if I am with her I am content to lay in a comfy bed close to her. I am trying to learn to sleep in my crate at night and if the crate is VERY close to my foster mom, I am ok. I have a very cute little 'song & dance' trick that also leads those that meet me to think I was once a pampered princess. I am petite and sweet and have been told I am very beautiful. I am looking to be someone's princess again -- could that someone be you?

03/19/2016	Pepper - Poodle (Miniature) (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Poodle (Miniature)	Oak Ridge, TN	Male	Posted Breed: Poodle (Miniature) (medium coat). Pepper is a very sweet, and very energetic 11-year-old male miniature poodle. He never meets a stranger; two-legged or four-legged, he loves everybody. He was adopted from SARG at the end of 2014 and is returning to us in March, 2016. His family feels he needs another dog or children to play with, to help him use up some of his boundless energy.                
03/19/2016	Mickey - Dachshund / Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund-Unknown Mix	Santa Cruz, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Dachshund / Terrier / Mixed. Mickey is 11 years old. Oh hey there! I'm Mickey, and I'm a pretty funny old feller. My favorite activities are sleeping, napping, and resting, and I would prefer a lazy afternoon over a game of fetch or a walk. My old bones just ain't what they used to be, so I'm not real fast on my feet. I can get a little choosy, too, about the way I'm touched, and would rather not be picked up. If I get surprised, I may react with a nip, so it would be hunky dory if someone came through the door who is looking for an old buddy to make them laugh from afar, but who isn't too keen on snuggling. If you've got a spare doggy bed that needs a champion snoozer to hold it down, then come on in and make my humble acquaintance. I can't wait to meetcha!

We can reduce his adoption fee to the right home if needed as he came in already neutered.    This great dog is all ready for a new home!  The adoption donation of $200.00 pays for this dog's medical care & also contributes to the medical care needed by other dog's that come into our rescue. (some dogs need hundreds of dollars worth of care to make them adoptable) Why purchase a dog for hundreds of dollars (that still needs vaccinations & neutering & microchip) when you can get this darling dog that already has everything and help other dogs at the same time???  Every life is precious! Thank you for your support.Call us at 805 674-1236 to make an appointment to see our fosters.. 9:00am - 6:00 pm California time please!

I’m Derek and I’m a male, black, Miniature Schnauzer with natural ears and a docked tail. I’m about nine years old and I weigh about fourteen pounds. I really enjoy interacting with my human friends. They’re fun! I’m friendly with all the people I’ve met so far. I like my four-legged friends and I do enjoy some outdoor time with them but I’m most interested in being your lap dog. I love sitting with you and I absolutely love being petted! I also love my toys and especially toys that squeak! I can really bring a toy to life and I like pushing and chasing my toys (or fetching them if you give them a toss)! I’m just a happy-go-lucky sort of guy and I can fit in just about anywhere. I like walks and I’m good on a leash. I’m crate trained (sometimes I bark in there, sometimes not) and I’m house trained too. Well, I say I am. SRT says they need a little more experience with that before signing off! Well, OK then. I like riding in the car and I’m quiet when we travel together. I don’t want to be seen with these lonely eyes any longer. I want to be seen with you!   Ask for Derek on your adoption application at www.SchnauzerRescueTexas.me                
03/19/2016	Cassie - Bichon Frise (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Bichon Frise	Mukwonago, WI	Female	Posted Breed: Bichon Frise (medium coat). ***Meet the dogs at our facility during open viewing hours, or by appointment, at 828 Perkins Dr, Mukwonago, WI.   Bichon and Little Buddies is open weekly on Thursdays, from 2-6:30 pm.  During this time you may meet the dogs and fill out a pre-adoption application which will be checked during the week. Dogs in foster homes require an appointment and approved application to meet. Other than during open hours, we do not show pets without an approved pre-adoption application and appointment.***Name: Cassie Breed: Bichon Age:  12 yr Gender: Female Weight: around 14 lb Adoption Fee: $150 Why in Rescue: Breeder Surrender/owner surrender General Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at www.bichonrescues.com/adoption.html if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.  Cassie was adopted, but now needs to find a new home as her owner's medical problems no longer allow her to care for a dog. Cassie still needs work with housetraining and is shy, but this sweet old girl deserves to be back in a home. Profile July 2015: Cassie and her friends all came from a home where they were used for breeding. Fortunately this breeder took good care of her dogs, and while they will need some time and patience to learn to become loved pets, they are more social than a lot of breeder dogs we see. Cassie did live in a puppy mill before she came to this breeder, so is a little more shy than some of the other dogs. She is nervous when you try to pick her up, but is a sweet girl. She is crate trained. She gets along with other dogs, and would do best with another small friendly dog in the house. She would love to meet you to see if she might be the perfect match for your home.  If considering adopting a former breeding dog, the following article is good to read to help you understand the special needs these dogs may have. http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/adopting-puppy-mill-dog   Adoption Procedures: 1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application. 2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.  3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.  4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!   The adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $150 - $450 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.  To assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $190 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc All dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies. The Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/preadoptionform.html Thanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!***Other than during open hours, we do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/adoption.html. Please do not call until AFTER you have filled out an application.*** ***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.*** ***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.*** ***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded (minus a $50 administration fee). Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.*** Bichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS

03/19/2016	Brass - Chihuahua (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chihuahua	Cabool, MO	Male	Posted Breed: Chihuahua (short coat). Brass has been featured on Petfinder since he was a pup.........and has had not one decent offer. He is so cute and such a house mouse! Now he is 8 years old, he needs a quiet home with pillows and yummies, that is warm and comfy!! ************************************************** Update: Sweet boy continues to live with his foster family, the only family he has known in his entire life. He is such a cute boy, silly and a major ham! This little dog is such a delight! He gets lost easily outside but really that is just another reason why he is the perfect home body buddy! At only 6 and half years old, he has lots of years of lovin left! POST Brass is sweet, gentle, sensitive, playful and affectionate. He is excellently tempered. Brass has a really neat brindling thing going on like marble.........just fantastic.....Born 9-26-06 -around 10 lbs but a baby forever, so easy to love. Brass has been in rescue since he was a tiny puppy but faces the challenge of thousands of Chihuahuas.........real life Chi's in a tiny dog world.  For every perfect tiny Chihuahua produced, several times that many are not and become the bi product or waste of the attempt to achieve tiny dogs that are marketable. The seven pound and up kids are just not marketable..........so why produce them? I will tell you why..........the hard core Chihuahua facts are that these are hugh commercial facilities that cannot/will not assist mothers in delivery or neonatal care. They need to be able to carry many strong puppies to earn their keep and deliver and feed them without any human assistance or they just cost time and money and are purged out. This means big strong mamas.........so to reach for the big money tiny dog, they are bred to undersized males.........undersized dogs are often suffering from overwhelming health conditions that pass thru to the pups. So the demands of greed call for big oversized moms and unhealthy unstable tiny dads creating litters for the pet market where the survivors are either tiny and marketed only for loving owners to learn later that they are not healthy or much harder to protect then a normal dog OR more commonly the oversized disposable kids that favor the mother, if they are accepted by a fooled broker they are sold cheap, given away, killed and if the broker sees they are oversized they are just destroyed before eating one more kibble on the greedy breeders tab! Often times breeders know the puppies will be larger like their mom so lie about their age, then you have month old puppies who should be still snuggled up safe with their mama being forced into the market place. Pretty unsafe and truly terrifying for the babies being trafficked fresh from the nest. Brass is lucky, his foster family loves him and after spending most all his life there, he is just considering himself a part of the family.........thousands are not so lucky and die or are left lingering in shelters, as the number two most killed in shelters breed in the nation. Looking for a Chihuahua Dog or Puppy? Why Not Adopt!                
03/19/2016	Wishbone - Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Jack Russell Terrier-Unknown Mix	Cabool, MO	Male	Posted Breed: Jack Russell Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Wishbone is a silly old boy with a terrier tude and the vocals of a grouchy grampa! He is funny and full of beans........he does GREAT with the terrier girls but doesnt much involve himself with the others. He is bossy and sometimes rude and the girls line him out without hesitation, he loves it!!!!!!!!! ******************************************************* Wishbone is a wonderful and lovable mature terrier with all the terrierisms in this world. He is great to cuddle with, loves to sleep in the bed, get a treat and take life one glorious minute at a time........this guy has spent most his life in shelters and foster care, doesnt every dog deserve to spend at least his golden years in the arms of parents who WANT him??!! Update: Wishbone continues to mature in his foster home, where he is happy but its not the same. He doesnt do well in active groups, like with puppies playing........ he has no tolerance for that kinda thing! He really needs a indoor/outdoor home with low population and plenty of yummy chews. Would do well with a strong female terrier. UPDATE JUNE 08: Wishbone is gaining weight and confidence! He is improving in his citizenship and will make a great buddy to a terrier lover! Wishbone would love a terrier sister but no alpha males for this guy.....he cannot be a submissive but glad to be an equal. He is active and smart and energetic and everything a terrier lover would want.ORIGINAL:Wishbone is the new guy.......a rescue up north closed down and on the last day poor Wishbone still stood there, unwanted, unclaimed and with no future. We couldnt have that and are arranging to take this boy in to foster care to prepare him for adoption. He is a little unnerved in large groups so will need a home with just a few dogs or would be happy as an only dog with a human home full time. Wishbone needs to gain weight as he prepares to be adopted!

Approaching her golden years, Rory likes to spend time warm and comfy......heat and fluffy beds and pillows and a bottomless food bowl are her priorities :) She loves her best buddy in foster care, Margo........a senior Boston Terrier. Their relationship has withstood a lot, when Margo was adopted and went away Rory missed her but when Margos new mom died and she came back to her foster home, she and Rory had a glorious reunion and it was good! They got right back into their routine and have been together since! Rory would probably like a house mate, cuddle buddy in a new home as well!  ******************************************  Foster mom update: Rory loves to play, small, large, young and old alike, she will play with anyone, comes when she is called and is flawlessly using the doggy door. She is good with the cats as well!! All she wants is a little basket to nap in and a good buddy to take in her day with, what a girl!!!   Rory has made a full recovery, is spayed and recently saw the vet who felt she had really done well in her recovery. She has a darling little butt wiggle when she walks and loves to go outside, walk and play. Her truest love is a nice basket with a pillow and a yummy!! Just a sweet little girl with a hip hop in her get up and go!! She may need arthritis pills in her maturity but that is not uncommon for all dogs. Vet guesses Rory at having approx. an 07 birthyear. Foster mom says she would struggle with more then 4 or 5 steep stairs if she had to do it everyday. Beagle lovers will not be able to resist her darling little Roo!! Heart of a Beagle that beats so true!!     Update: Rory found the help she needed and is on her feet again! She walks around and enjoys the yard! Havent taken her on the open trail and never let her out when its cold outside like in the morning or night cause she doesnt need that! She has broken her confines and her progress has been great. She never let her spirit fail, she has been positive, cooperative and stead fast through it all. She has the most darling little girl hound song which she will use at will in the presents of yummies!! Any Beagle lovers dream!!! New pics will be coming soon! Her rescue Angel, Alex who stood by her every single step she has taken in her recovery will be glad to love her till a new opportunity is made available for her!!     Good Doctor says our Rory can make a full recovery, all systems seem to be a go and its down to rest up and heel time, with some potti assistance till her squat is back on track!! We are thanking our lucky stars!!! She was severely infested with ticks, totaling over 115!!        Emergency Foster says: ""She is in lot of pain, and can't get around at all. She needs a safe indoor place to rest. She needs help to get up to pee and when she pees on herself, she needs cleaned up. This dog will need nursing care and soon! Rory is on Pain meds and antibiotics for several more days yet despite it all, she remains sweet and loving and thankful for any kindness shown to her, its heartbreaking.""     Rory has suffered a broken Pelvis. She will need rehab to include a quiet soft spot, someone to keep her cleaned up and make sure she gets her pain meds as she heels. Eventually, she will need some support like towel walking to get back on those feet once the bone has begun to heel.     Tragic situation: Rescue Care is contagious.....one of our foundation foster moms is a dance teacher. She shares with her students and they participate in helping us a lot with fundraisers and volunteer support under her guidance. They were driving down the highway and much to there horror, the truck in front of them struck a small Beagle. The hit and run driver just continued on his way without so much as hitting the brakes. This dog is in critical care at a nearby vet hospital!!! With the heat bellowing off that highway she would died a horrible torturous death! More info to come!                "

She knows no strangers, loves the car, gets along with all other animals (though loves to chase cats if they will run!) and is very high energy.

Every life is precious! Thank you for your support.Call us at 805 674-1236 to make an appointment to see our fosters.. 9:00am - 6:00 pm California time please!                "

03/19/2016	Leda - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Denver, CO	Female	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed. Leda Australian Cattle Dog Mix Female 5 years old 38 lbs. Hi! I’m Leda and I’m the New Girl at PawsCo. That’s right, I’m a bit quirky (please don’t call me “adorkable” though!). You see, I used to live in Wyoming until my owner died. Now I feel a little insecure because of all the changes I’ve experienced. I like dogs once I get to know them. I love running around outside with a toy—it doesn’t matter if it’s demolished, I will love it! I can get so excited! If someone is working or watching TV, I’m content to just lie like a rug on the floor. But if I see a leash and know a walk is —BINGO! SO EXCITED! I might ignore a cat for days and then decide it’s time to play. I’m food motivated so that’s exciting too! Did someone say food?! I’m a smart girl and a fast learner. I come when I’m called and will spend all night quietly in a crate, especially if there’s a treat to sweeten the deal. (Treat?!) I don’t love to be touched by people I don’t know, but I have a cute habit of leaning into people who make me feel safe. I guess I am adorkable after all! It won’t be long ’til I’m gonna need somebody to lean on. Can I please lean on you? All you need to do is email adopt@pawscoadoptions.org or fill out an adoption application at https://pawsco.org/adopt/adoption-application/. And I'll be your friend—I'll help you carry on!

03/19/2016	Boston - Labrador Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Denver, CO	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed. Boston Labrador Retriever Mix Male 6 years old 66 lbs. Hello! My name is Boston and I am SUCH a special guy looking for my perfect home! What makes me so special you wonder? Well…where do I start! There are just so many things, really, but I am most famous for how cuddly and affectionate I am! I just love people and am always happy and eager to say hello! I also am famous for how I talk. I am not a big barker, except at the usual stuff like mailmen and other visitors. But I like to let people know when I am happy by making cute little noises. My foster family gave me a new bone the other day and to show my appreciation I pranced around with it in my mouth making noise. It’s important to train your family, so I always let them know when they are doing a good job <wink, wink>. My foster family just thinks my “talking” is adorable and I know you will too! I hope to find a family that will take me on lots of fun adventures so I can have my daily exercise, but will also give me love and cuddle time when it’s time to just relax around the house. I love being around my family and will follow you everywhere if you let me. I love other dogs, too, so if you already have pups at home I could blend right in (I just need to be fed separately from other dogs as I can tend to be a little protective of my food.) I also really like being in a house with a yard so I’m not the right fit for a home in an apartment.  I’m also very trustworthy in the home. When my foster family isn’t home, I stay in the house and never ruin or destroy anything. I am potty trained and know some basic commands, but am excited about the possibility of learning lots of new things as well! I do want to mention that I have an eye condition that requires daily eye drops (which costs about $50/month) and there is a chance that my vision might slowly worsen over time. The nice vet partners with PawsCo have completely checked me out and know that, whether I see perfectly or not, I will still have an amazing life! I just need a loving family who can be understanding about this need and give me the patience and understanding as my vision may adjust. PawsCo can fill you in on all the details about my condition. I just want to find that special someone (or someones!) who will make me a part of their forever family. If you think I’m meant to be your new best friend, fill out an application at www.pawsco.org/adopt/adoption-application or email adopt@pawscoadoptions.org.

We do not have a facility for you to visit.   WE PROCESS APPLICANTS AND SET APPOINTMENTS BASED ON THE ORDER APPLICATIONS ARE RECEIVED   , so while you are welcome to call (248) 834-9419 or email  ccrcdogs@ccrcdogs.com with specific questions, you will want to complete the   ONLINE APPLICATION  ASAP ,   which can be found at www.ccrcdogs.com,  to secure your position in line for one of our dogs. You can also find  a description of our process on that same page. Puppies will not be available to be seen until their 10 day quarantine has passed. Our adoption fee is $200 for adults and $275 for puppies, which covers the cost of the spay/neuter, age appropriate shots and tests, medications to bring the dog to full health, and a free visit with one of our approved vets after adoption. The majority of dogs at CCRC are obtained from animal control centers, so there is often very little known about their history or even current habits. You can always expect to do some training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. CCRC provides a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this, as well as telephone support.

Frankie was with us at last weekend's meet and greet event, and everyone enjoyed how happy he was- this little guy never stopped wagging! He is a bit of a whiner if he wants attention, and he's not above hopping on your lap, but he considers that a positive trait, not a fault!  Just remember: Frankie = Fun!

Description:   D# A4925848 Paulie is a darling 5-year-old creamy-white female Miniature Poodle who entered the Baldwin Park Animal Care Center on March 7th as a stray from La Puente. Weighing 10 lbs, Paulie is quite a pretty pup! She could use a spa treatment, but with the bit of grooming she got by a volunteer on Glamour Shot day (for which she sat and behaved perfectly— she’s obviously accustomed to being beautified) and her ringlet hair, there is not a lot of room for improvement where this hypoallergenic pooch is concerned. Paulie loves other dogs, running up to meet them without hesitation; she has a soft puppy-like energy; she walks fine on leash; she loves being carried and cuddled; she’s gentle; and she bonds with humans quickly (she’s trusting). We noticed that she sometimes hops with her rear left leg, so that, if it continues, may need to be checked. We think Paulie is a perfect plug-and-play dog who will make a valued inside companion for any individual or family, including one with kids (as long as they respect her small size).

She is loving, fun and raring to go. According to her previous pet parents she is house trained and the only reason for her surrender to the Center is that they could no longer care for her. This pretty lady would love to have her positive training continued and hopes her new family will give her plenty of physical and mental exercise. She maybe a little selective when it comes to other dogs and a careful meet and greet with other dogs living in her new home is needed to make sure they are compatible. Ce Ce may do best with respectful school age children.

Pet Information CONTACT: UHA ADOPTION COORDINATOR KRISTIN AT 626-393-6258 OR AT kristin@hope4animals.org Description:   ID# A4910191 Rudy is a dreamy 2-year-old black-brown male Manchester Terrier mix who came to the Baldwin Park Animal Care Center as an owner surrender (we don’t know why) on January 9th. Weighing 10 lbs and sporting a coat that is truly a striking mix of black and brown, Rudy is feeling unsafe in the shelter environment, enough so that he balked at being  on leash and sought comfort in the arms of his handler all the time he was in the yard. So we don’t know whether he walks well on leash or is house trained; but we do know that he’s snuggly, good with other small dogs, and shows no aggression despite being frightened and on high-alert. We’re thinking that he’ll blossom in his forever home with care, attention, and probably some basics training to build his confidence. He’s a loving little fellow who we think will make a rewarding indoor pet and companion for those who give him love and security.

03/19/2016	Poppy - Boxer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Arlington, VA	Female	Posted Breed: Boxer (short coat). Poppy was surrendered to a rural high-kill shelter in SC. She was in good health and up to date on vet care, so you have to wonder what happened to her family. Maybe they fell on hard times, or someone passed away, but she was definitely an inside dog who was once loved and cared for as part of a family.    Poppy is a good-natured Boxer who is about 6 years old and weighs 52 pounds. She recently put on a few extra pounds, but her foster mom is working to help her slim down with daily walks and visits to the dog park, which Poppy really enjoys. She does well meeting other dogs on and off leash, and has lived with other dogs in the past.   This adorable pup is quickly becoming popular in her new neighborhood with her cute little Boxer underbite, big smile, and gorgeous auburn coat that makes her stand out. Her foster mom says that neighbors regularly stop to meet her and she’s done well greeting everyone.    Poppy is both crate trained and housetrained, and is not destructive in the home when left alone. Her foster mom currently gives her free roam when she’s gone, and she’s proven to be a very well behaved, calm dog indoors. She loves belly rubs and has become a huge fan of hanging out on the couch in her foster home.    Her foster mom describes Poppy as a loving and affectionate pup, but not a needy dog who needs constant attention and reassurance. She does like to be near you and hang out with her person, and follows her foster mom around, always aware of where she is and what she’s up to.    Poppy needs a calm, confident owner to lead her, and like most dogs really responds to her person’s energy and home environment. She would be great as an only dog or with another pup companion in the home. This adorable Boxer girl needs a loving, nurturing home to live out her golden years and will make a great addition to your family.    BREED ESTIMATE: Boxer GENDER: Female APPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 52lbs (should be about 47-50lbs) APPROXIMATE AGE: 6 years old COAT TYPE: Short ADOPTION FEE: $350 OTHER INFO: Fostered in Arlington, VA     FOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to http://adopt.ddbnova.org and complete the application.

03/19/2016	Sterling - Pit Bull Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Lake Arrowhead, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier. Hi, folks. My name is Sterling. My daughter, Daisy, and I were found abandonded, abused and emaciated on the streets of San Bernardino by the good folks at CBC. I guess I must have tried too hard to make sure my girl got the lion's share of the groceries, when we got them, as I collapsed as soon as I got to the doctor. The kind people helped us get well, and add some pounds to our frames. I hold no grudges, I'm good with all people, dogs and even cats. I am so very happy to be alive and well, I am working hard and already am great in a crate, on a leash, and am learning commands. I'm fully vetted, and no more kids for me. Please consider adopting me - my first two years weren't the best; so I know that the very best is yet to come. I hope you're a part of my forever after.

03/19/2016	Paddy - Shih Tzu Dog For Adoption	rescue	Shih Tzu	Atlanta, GA	Male	Posted Breed: Shih Tzu. Paddy finds himself a bit down on his luck. We hope you can be his lucky charm! Paddy is a wonderful boy who found himself homeless after he could not adjust to living with a cat. He is social and affectionate and reportedly walks well on leash, is crate trained and an affectionate guy. We know he is new to the adoption center, but he is a bit stressed being here. We hope we can find his right home quickly. His ideal home will be one without a lot of chaos. He is used to living with a single adult female and he really loved being king of the castle. While he does okay with other dogs we feel like he’d really love to be an only child. Let Paddy be the pot of gold at the end of your rainbow!                
03/19/2016	Sunny - German Shepherd Dog / Golden Retriever Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Gretna, NE	Female	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog / Golden Retriever. German Shepherd dogs are a highly active, energetic, working breed. They require considerable exercise, socialization, training, leadership and mental stimuli in order to be well-adjusted, well-balanced, and well-mannered dogs. If you are new to German Shepherds, please research the breed to make sure this is the dog for you. We ask that you consider the time and financial commitment that your German Shepherd will require before applying for one. Heartland German Shepherd Rescue (HUGS) dogs will receive necessary veterinary care and will be up-to-date on vaccinations, tested for Heartworm disease (started on Heartworm preventative, or treated if Heartworm positive), spayed or neutered, and microchipped.Sunny is a gorgeous, very sweet, approx 1.5 y.o. girl who up until rescue lived as a stray on the reservation. Reservation dogs lead a very hard life with no shelter, little food, and no vet care. Many of them die young due to accidents, deprivation, and/or sickness among other causes. Sunny is one of the lucky ones, to have made it into rescue. All she needs now, is a wonderful forever home of her own :).  Sunny is very good and submissive with other dogs. She is learning her basic commands and doing very well. She has adjusted beautifully to life as a family pet, and she will make a wonderful companion for a very lucky adopter.  Sunny is good with people. She is more trusting of strange women than men, initially, but she has warmed up to everyone in her foster home, and she is a very sweet, lovable girl.  Sunny is a gorgeous, petite girl, with a calm and mellow disposition, who would be a great fit for anyone looking for a loving, easy-going companion.

Puppies up to 6 months $425, Puppies up to 1yr $375; Adult Dogs (1-6yr) $325; Senior Dogs (7yr+) $275; Senior Plus Dogs (10yr+) $225.                                                            There is a $25 non-refundable fee associated with the application for adoption that must be paid before your application can be processed.                                                            In the event that you are denied for any reason, or that you may decide not to adopt from HUGS at this time, for any reason, the $25 application fee is non-refundable and will be treated as a donation to the HUGS dogs. These are our regular adoption fees. From time to time, a high-profile pet may have a slightly higher adoption fee. All adoption fees go back into the dogs that we rescue. Applicants who submitted applications prior to 2-19-2016, will pay our original adoption fees but no application fee:                               Puppies up to 6 months $450, Puppies up to 1yr $400; Adult Dogs (1-6yr) $350; Senior Dogs (7yr+) $300; Senior Plus Dogs (10yr+) $250.                                    As part of the application process, we ask that you provide references (to include a veterinarian, if applicable) and that you allow us to conduct a home visit.  While we prefer to adopt dogs locally, we may consider other qualified Midwest applicants within an approximate 200 mile radius of the Omaha-Lincoln, NE area, on a case-by-case basis, for dogs who may not have sufficient local interest. We may consider larger distances for harder-to-place dogs (ex: dogs who need to be the only pet in the household, etc...).                                In all cases, we must be able to complete a home visit that meets our standards. Applicants must be willing to travel to the Omaha-Lincoln area for an adoption meet and greet with their prospective new HUGS dog. All household members, including current dogs, must attend the meet and greet.  Submission of an application for adoption is not a guarantee of approval. There is no guarantee that applicants will be approved to adopt a specific dog, or that a specific dog will still be available by the time that your application is approved. Applications are valid for 1 year from the time of submission. After 1 year, you will be asked to re-apply. Thank you for your understanding.  All HUGS dogs MUST be INSIDE dogs in their adoptive home. HUGS dogs may NOT be backyard, porch, outdoor kennel, dog house or garage dogs. NO EXCEPTIONS, PLEASE.

Adopting A Shelter Dog These dogs come without background histories/ past medical information. We present these dogs as we have observed in relationship to age, size, breed, behavior, housebreaking, crate training, good with children, cats, dogs, and strangers. Dogs may present themselves differently in different environments, therefore The Dog Spot Rescue, their agents, volunteers, can not guarantee behavior, age, size expectations, breed, house Training, destructive behavior tendencies, and/or medical issues. All dogs from shelters have been subjected to pathogens from the shelter level which can materialize into disease in the future. Each adopter must observe for themselves pre-adoption and make decisions for themselves the suitability of said dog and their tolerance levels for transitional time when adopting a shelter dog. We ask that each adopter take their time when making the choice to bring home a rescued dog.Angel is a gorgeous boxer mix with her smow white coat and one pretty blue eye. She is always happy to see you and will roll over for a belly rub instantly. Angel is completely deaf but will watch for your signal and does know some hand signs.

Any dog that shows symptoms here at TDS are routinely identified, taken for tests and treatment. Our vet bills can exceed $10,000 a month. However, without symptoms, we may miss a disease, or pre-existing condition or parasite. Consider carefully if you have the tolerance for these possibilities. We consider, you, the adopters, the last leg of the rescue process.

03/19/2016	Sophia - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Orlando, FL	Female	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Sophia, A beautiful loving mixed breed shelter rescue approx 4 1/2 years old. She is up to date on all shots, being a inside the house family member is a must as she has very pink skin that will burn easily in the sun and is not a fun time for her. She is very house broken, has never chewed anything up in the house that i can remember, she knows basic command,especially give kisses.  Sophia is a great girl she loves to swim,go to the park and chase thrown balls,and car rides are her favorite as her and i always split a double cheeseburger ( that is our lil secret from the wife) when you come home from work she will meet you at the door with so much love and excitement that it will make a bad day feel not so bad,she is a great sleeper as she rotates between me on the bed or my wife on the couch.She will know when your sick or not feeling good and try to comfort you. She is other dog social,like today at the vet she was so well behaved, especially around dogs her size or bigger. I loved watching her let the little dogs eat there food then when they are finished she will move in and eat her share she is such a sweetheart. She has alot of energy, so i wouldnt think that having very small dogs around her would be a great idea.  It truly breaks our hearts, but we have to find a home that will love her as much as we do, as she is a beautiful girl with a beautiful soul and deserves no less. Please remember she is a Inside family member due to her skin lightness,that is a must for this little princess.   Thank you Tony McCartt 321-247-1753

I’m Journey and I’m not going to stop believing that someone is out there, right now, who is going to be my forever home. I thought I found that home a year ago when I was adopted from APRA. Unfortunately, it was only for a year. I have so much to offer and give my family and I hope I can find a home that will have me years and years and years. I can be a bit timid with new people, but love with all my heart. Due to my shyness, my ideal home will be relaxed and patient. I walk well on leash, enjoy playing with toys and love snuggling. When I am super happy I “smile!” I do well with other dogs but really love people. I’m just a city boy ready to take the midnight train to forever!

I'm imagining a little puppy we could carry in our arms and he showed up with this pretty girl -- a big girl. When looking at her paws, we thought we could see numbers and letters and named her illusion. Plus, she reminds us a little of our Magic Man and thought Illusion was a name comparable to Magic. She is probably a year old, VERY timid, and has no idea what she is supposed to do on leash. We have paired her up with Kina in a kennel so she can have some confidence building and can see the humans as we walk back and forth. She is a pretty girl -- very tall.

03/19/2016	Sissy - German Shepherd Dog Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Gretna, NE	Female	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog. German Shepherd dogs are a highly active, energetic, working breed. They require considerable exercise, socialization, training, leadership and mental stimuli in order to be well-adjusted, well-balanced, and well-mannered dogs. If you are new to German Shepherds, please research the breed to make sure this is the dog for you. We ask that you consider the time and financial commitment that your German Shepherd will require before applying for one. Heartland German Shepherd Rescue (HUGS) dogs will receive necessary veterinary care and will be up-to-date on vaccinations, tested for Heartworm disease (started on Heartworm preventative, or treated if Heartworm positive), spayed or neutered, and microchipped.Sissy is a gorgeous, very sweet, approx 1.5 y.o. girl who up until rescue lived as a stray on the reservation. Reservation dogs lead a very hard life with no shelter, little food, and no vet care. Many of them die young due to accidents, deprivation, and/or sickness among other causes. Sissy is one of the lucky ones, as she made it into rescue :).Sissy is a delightful girl! She can be a bit shy initially, but she is a very sweet girl and warms up quickly! Sissy is happy all of the time and loves to cuddle. She is great with kids, other dogs, and cats. She aims to please and is eager to learn. Sissy follows directions well and loves she to play. Sissy loves to get attention, be loved and played with. She likes to play in the backyard with other dogs, and with the kids, and she enjoys her walks! Sissy is slowly getting better at leash-walking and she will need her new owner to continue working on this with her.  Sissy is a great girl who will make a fantastic family dog for a very lucky adopter!                               Adoption fees: Effective 2-19-2016. Puppies up to 6 months $425, Puppies up to 1yr $375; Adult Dogs (1-6yr) $325; Senior Dogs (7yr+) $275; Senior Plus Dogs (10yr+) $225.                                                            There is a $25 non-refundable fee associated with the application for adoption that must be paid before your application can be processed.                                                            In the event that you are denied for any reason, or that you may decide not to adopt from HUGS at this time, for any reason, the $25 application fee is non-refundable and will be treated as a donation to the HUGS dogs. These are our regular adoption fees. From time to time, a high-profile pet may have a slightly higher adoption fee. All adoption fees go back into the dogs that we rescue. Applicants who submitted applications prior to 2-19-2016, will pay our original adoption fees but no application fee:                               Puppies up to 6 months $450, Puppies up to 1yr $400; Adult Dogs (1-6yr) $350; Senior Dogs (7yr+) $300; Senior Plus Dogs (10yr+) $250.                                    As part of the application process, we ask that you provide references (to include a veterinarian, if applicable) and that you allow us to conduct a home visit.  While we prefer to adopt dogs locally, we may consider other qualified Midwest applicants within an approximate 200 mile radius of the Omaha-Lincoln, NE area, on a case-by-case basis, for dogs who may not have sufficient local interest. We may consider larger distances for harder-to-place dogs (ex: dogs who need to be the only pet in the household, etc...).                                In all cases, we must be able to complete a home visit that meets our standards. Applicants must be willing to travel to the Omaha-Lincoln area for an adoption meet and greet with their prospective new HUGS dog. All household members, including current dogs, must attend the meet and greet.  Submission of an application for adoption is not a guarantee of approval. There is no guarantee that applicants will be approved to adopt a specific dog, or that a specific dog will still be available by the time that your application is approved. Applications are valid for 1 year from the time of submission. After 1 year, you will be asked to re-apply. Thank you for your understanding.  All HUGS dogs MUST be INSIDE dogs in their adoptive home. HUGS dogs may NOT be backyard, porch, outdoor kennel, dog house or garage dogs. NO EXCEPTIONS, PLEASE.

Hey There! I am Brittany, a 5-6 month old mixed breed girl. I have a beautiful tan coat and cute white ""socks"" on my feet. I am as cute as they come, especially when I am working hard to listen and please. I love to work for food and play with toys. I am learning cues like sit and down and am working on not jumping when I meet people. I just get so excited and like to go, go, go! I crate very nicely and am quiet while I wait for my turn to play. I LOVE to play with other dogs and would benefit from another dog in the house who enjoys playing as much as I do. I have a lot of energy and with a doggy friend, we could wear each other out!  Come meet me soon and we could be playing together in no time!  We do not have a facility for you to visit.   WE PROCESS APPLICANTS AND SET APPOINTMENTS BASED ON THE ORDER APPLICATIONS ARE RECEIVED   , so while you are welcome to call (248) 834-9419 or email  ccrcdogs@ccrcdogs.com with specific questions, you will want to complete the   ONLINE APPLICATION  ASAP ,   which can be found at www.ccrcdogs.com,  to secure your position in line for one of our dogs. You can also find  a description of our process on that same page. Puppies will not be available to be seen until their 10 day quarantine has passed. Our adoption fee is $200 for adults and $275 for puppies, which covers the cost of the spay/neuter, age appropriate shots and tests, medications to bring the dog to full health, and a free visit with one of our approved vets after adoption. The majority of dogs at CCRC are obtained from animal control centers, so there is often very little known about their history or even current habits. You can always expect to do some training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. CCRC provides a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this, as well as telephone support.                "

03/19/2016	Leo - Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Shelburne, VT	Male	"Posted Breed: Retriever / Mixed. **COURTESY POST ** IN VERMONT ** Meet Leo! Here is his video from Oct. 2014 in S Carolina (will get an updated video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0M93C5AtaE&feature=youtu.be Meet Leo! Updated pictures and video to come. He approx. 1 1/2 years old, male, vetted, neutered, and micro-chipped. Leo is not doing well in his current environment and needs to find a new home. Leo is best with a dog savvy owner/s where he can get the structure and guidance he needs. He is currently in an environment where he feels the need to protect his owner and his property; he didn't start out like that. But Leo truly just wants to be a happy dog and not carry that stress and responsibility. He does well on pack walks with Trail Tails VT other dogs and at his classes Play Dog Play; so we know he can do well with the right environment. Leo loves to go for car rides, he is potty trained, he is a medium-high energy, he knows ""Stay, Sit, Place, Break, and Come"" sometimes. He is all work when it is quiet but when he gets excited he loses focus. If you are interested in adopting Leo please fill out an Application at our website at www.Passion-4-Paws.org (pls make sure you have the Vermont site) or if you have an Application already in let us know! Check out his Facebook page (please ""Like"" us while you are there): http://tinyurl.com/jhr67u3  Disclosure:    Breed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog’s DNA determines appearance!  Passion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as “dog friendly” and “child friendly” should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.                "

I am learning a new command, which is ""ignore."" Since I am smart and treat-motivated, I will soon learn that ""ignore"" means that I do not have to bark and growl but to instead look at you for assurance.   I have a big heart and just want to spend time hanging out with you on the couch, sunning myself on a sunny warm spot on the floor or go hiking with you. I am well-behaved in the car.

Please don’t let this patch of hair drive you away from me. I like to look at this missing patch of hair in a positive light because I get to wear dresses and shirts to protect me from the sun.

03/19/2016	Gracie - German Shepherd Dog Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Gretna, NE	Female	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog. German Shepherd dogs are a highly active, energetic, working breed. They require considerable exercise, socialization, training, leadership and mental stimuli in order to be well-adjusted, well-balanced, and well-mannered dogs. If you are new to German Shepherds, please research the breed to make sure this is the dog for you. We ask that you consider the time and financial commitment that your German Shepherd will require before applying for one. Heartland German Shepherd Rescue (HUGS) dogs will receive necessary veterinary care and will be up-to-date on vaccinations, tested for Heartworm disease (started on Heartworm preventative, or treated if Heartworm positive), spayed or neutered, and microchipped.Gracie is a gorgeous, very sweet, approx 1.5 y.o. girl who up until rescue lived as a stray on the reservation. Reservation dogs lead a very hard life with no shelter, little food, and no vet care. Many of them die young due to accidents, deprivation, and/or sickness among other causes. Gracie is one of the lucky ones, to have made it into rescue. All she needs now, is a wonderful forever home of her own :).  Gracie is very good and submissive with other dogs. She is learning her basic commands and doing very well. She has adjusted beautifully to life as a family pet, and she will make a wonderful companion for a very lucky adopter.  Gracie is good with people. She is more trusting of strange women than men, initially, but she has warmed up to everyone in her foster home, and she is a very sweet, lovable girl.  Gracie is a gorgeous, petite girl, with a calm and mellow disposition, who would be a great fit for anyone looking for a loving, easy-going companion.                               Adoption fees: Effective 2-19-2016. Puppies up to 6 months $425, Puppies up to 1yr $375; Adult Dogs (1-6yr) $325; Senior Dogs (7yr+) $275; Senior Plus Dogs (10yr+) $225.                                                            There is a $25 non-refundable fee associated with the application for adoption that must be paid before your application can be processed.                                                            In the event that you are denied for any reason, or that you may decide not to adopt from HUGS at this time, for any reason, the $25 application fee is non-refundable and will be treated as a donation to the HUGS dogs. These are our regular adoption fees. From time to time, a high-profile pet may have a slightly higher adoption fee. All adoption fees go back into the dogs that we rescue. Applicants who submitted applications prior to 2-19-2016, will pay our original adoption fees but no application fee:                               Puppies up to 6 months $450, Puppies up to 1yr $400; Adult Dogs (1-6yr) $350; Senior Dogs (7yr+) $300; Senior Plus Dogs (10yr+) $250.                                    As part of the application process, we ask that you provide references (to include a veterinarian, if applicable) and that you allow us to conduct a home visit.  While we prefer to adopt dogs locally, we may consider other qualified Midwest applicants within an approximate 200 mile radius of the Omaha-Lincoln, NE area, on a case-by-case basis, for dogs who may not have sufficient local interest. We may consider larger distances for harder-to-place dogs (ex: dogs who need to be the only pet in the household, etc...).                                In all cases, we must be able to complete a home visit that meets our standards. Applicants must be willing to travel to the Omaha-Lincoln area for an adoption meet and greet with their prospective new HUGS dog. All household members, including current dogs, must attend the meet and greet.  Submission of an application for adoption is not a guarantee of approval. There is no guarantee that applicants will be approved to adopt a specific dog, or that a specific dog will still be available by the time that your application is approved. Applications are valid for 1 year from the time of submission. After 1 year, you will be asked to re-apply. Thank you for your understanding.  All HUGS dogs MUST be INSIDE dogs in their adoptive home. HUGS dogs may NOT be backyard, porch, outdoor kennel, dog house or garage dogs. NO EXCEPTIONS, PLEASE.

03/19/2016	Sugar Halifax - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Rockaway, NJ	Female	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Meet Sugar!!  This beautiful girl is a blue Pit Bull Terrier mix, about 3 years old. This girl despite her awful life loves people and gets along with other dogs. When she was first found she was starving, had been shot in the head, and had been dumped along with her 1-week old puppies. Because she was pregnant, Sugar's former owner tried to kill her!! Can you believe that? She has gained weight, her gunshot wound has healed, and all her puppies have been adopted. It's now Sugar's turn to find a loving home. Sugar is heart worm positive and has started treatment.  Eleventh Hour Rescue will pay for the completion of the treatment. What does this mean? It means that for the next month Sugar will need a lot of rest as she continues treatment. After her treatment is over, she will be healthy and can run and play. Sugar is a shy, loving girl who will make a loving pet. Sugar is now in foster in New Jersey and as you can see from the first two pictures getting loved by the son and cuddled by another foster.    Sugar is up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and micro chipped. If you are interested in Sugar go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application. Don't forget to mention SUGAR HALIFAX!!!

Please contact Lea (gsdhouse@comcast.net) for more information about this pet.3/7/16  Once Molly knows you, she is a sweet girl who tries very hard to please. She tends to meet new people with a little growl, but as soon as you give her a treat, she is OK with you. Interestingly enough, yesterday she was playing with a good sized rock in my back yard, and she was growling at the rock for all she was worth! She would be OK with a submissive dog, but would probably butt heads with a pushy dog. Her manners are improving in the car with each ride we take. She is well behaved in the house and does not do any inappropriate chewing. She has a huge bark and is an excellent watchdog! She did very well at the local dog park and had lots of fun chasing tennis balls.

Dogs may present themselves differently in different environments, therefore The Dog Spot Rescue, their agents, volunteers, can not guarantee behavior, age, size expectations, breed, house Training, destructive behavior tendencies, and/or medical issues. All dogs from shelters have been subjected to pathogens from the shelter level which can materialize into disease in the future. Each adopter must observe for themselves pre-adoption and make decisions for themselves the suitability of said dog and their tolerance levels for transitional time when adopting a shelter dog.

Any dog that shows symptoms here at TDS are routinely identified, taken for tests and treatment. Our vet bills can exceed $10,000 a month. However, without symptoms, we may miss a disease, or pre-existing condition or parasite. Consider carefully if you have the tolerance for these possibilities.

Princess was one of the Rockville 66, rescued with over 60 other dogs from a hoarding situation on New Year's Day. Most of the dogs appeared to have been living in crates. The seizure doubled the local shelter's dog population. When rescued, at just 15 lbs, this tiny girl had an apple-sized mass on her right shoulder. Initial cytology, indictated mesenchymal neoplasia (a localized cancer). On 2/23, Princess made it down to Blacksburg and had her surgical consult. GOOD NEWS! No metastases, strong heart, and a good candidate for anesthesia. BAD NEWS! A full amputation was recommended. On 3/2, the surgery was successfully preformed and we are thrilled to say that the cancer was completely excised and is unlikely to recur or metastasize! No chemo needed! Princess will not be ready for her new home until 2/23 but we are now prescreening applicants! Rlease review our adoption process and submit a non-binding application: http://www.kninerescue.com/info/adoption  If you can't adopt but wish to donate to the cost of her surgery, we'd appreciate that too! https://www.youcaring.com/KRIprincess                
03/19/2016	NY/Chief - French Brittany (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Curwensville, PA	Male	Posted Breed: French Brittany (medium coat). Chief is a 6 year old black and white French Brittany who is neutered, current on vaccines, crate trained, leash trained and very friendly. He is heart worm negative and on preventative. Chief was surrendered by his family because issues with the neighbors (they would shoot at Chief if he came on their property) to keep him safe. He is very good with children, other dogs, loves to ride in the car and generally gentle. Cats are considered prey to him so not recommended to be around Chief. Chief is fed a diet of grain free food as the dye in highly colored dog food can affect his system. He is a silly and goofy boy who enjoys playing with his foster siblings, loves to be outside, sleeps in his foster parents' room in a dog bed and seeks out a good bone to chew. Chief knows basic commands and comes to his name when called.  Chief is an active boy who has been trustworthy when left free in the house. His surrendering family reported there was some degree of separation anxiety that has not been observed by his foster family. Chief is crated when his foster parents have to leave. He is social and plays well with his foster siblings. Several times he has jumped the yard fence, but it is to go be with his foster dad as he is doing chores. He likes to be with his people and is not a wanderer. Adequate exercise and activity provided has helped Chief adjust to not being free to wander. Chief has a strong prey drive and is very interested in watching birds and small game.  If you are interested in adopting Chief, please visit www.NBRAN.org to complete an adoption application and then contact your state or provincial coordinator. The fee to adopt Chief is $350.00 to offset his vetting and to allow NBRAN to rescue more Britts in need.

03/19/2016	Adoption pending - Chester - Dachshund (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dachshund	South Weymouth, SC	Male	Posted Breed: Dachshund (short coat). Hello world! My name is Chester. A wonderful lady from Little Paws rescued me and my brothers and sisters from an awful breeding situation in GA. We use to live 24 hours a day in a small outdoor enclosure. Wow, have our lives changed! I’ve discovered life outside of those four walls and I’ve realized there’s so much to learn—I love learning!  I am a pretty mellow and easy-going guy. I sniff everything I see and perk my ears to everything I hear. I’m a little shy to a new environment, but I warm up pretty quickly. Because of my previous life, I’m a little jumpy at times, so I ask you to be patient with me while I get acclimated. My favorite activity is napping, preferably in the sun (I love vitamin D!). I sleep so much I could give Aurora a run for her money. I’m currently living with my foster brother who is showing me the ropes on how to be a proper dachshund, like playing with toys and burrowing under blankets. I’ve always grown up with other dogs, so I definitely need a brother or sister in my forever home. I’m taking a potty training course with my foster mom, who says I’m about 85% there. As long as I go out in the morning, afternoon, and at night, my mom says I could pass with flying colors! I love my crate and prefer to sleep there at night or anytime during the day when you’re gone. My foster dad gives me a massage every day so I’ll be expecting one from you (my foster brother says we doxies always get our way, especially if we give the “puppy eyes” look.). I would love to be a part of your fur-ever family! Want to know more about me?

03/19/2016	Lani - Beagle Dog For Adoption	rescue	Beagle	Las Vegas, NV	Female	Posted Breed: Beagle. Lani was used for breeding solely and then when she was used up after she had a recent litter, she was dumped into a kill shelter. She is sweet although nervous as she has had hardly any human contact. She has never walked on a leash. She has some medical issues we are taking care of such as a hole in her face from an infection in her mouth that was never treated. She needs many teeth out, over 20 or 30 and has an ear infection. She is not house trained and quite possibly has never been indoors before. She has never had a toy. With time and love, she will come around and make a wonderful addition to a family.  We have had her about a month now and she is slowly coming around. Will still tense up with touch and be frightened with sudden movement. She is getting better about being on a leash and is coming around a bit more. She also will play with a toy occasionally and this warms our heart.   adoption fee is $250. Adoption fees go back to and cover all of the medical for all of the dogs. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro chipped upon adoption and many have received further treatment for such things as lump removal, severe ear infections, leg injuries, etc.. For more information or to submit an adoption application, please visit our website at http://www.southernnevadabeaglerescue.com . We are also on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/SouthernNevadaBeagleRescueFoundation . Come meet and play with our available dogs at Las Vegas area dog parks.

All our dogs are in foster homes so not all are available to attend all our park meetups. Our meetup group playdates allow you to socialize your beagle with his/her own breed at dog parks with large fenced areas where the beagles can run and play off-leash. Beagle enthusiasts, come bay with us..... AROOOOOOOOOOOO!

03/19/2016	Hazel 4494 - German Shepherd Dog (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Sterling, VA	Female	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (long coat). Please contact Lea (gsdhouse@comcast.net) for more information about this pet.  14 March 2016      Hazel is as beautiful as she is sweet. She loves to play with other dogs and lived with children and a small dog in her previous home. She is very affectionate and what I consider to be a Velcro dog.        She rides beautifully in the car and has learned to walk nicely on a leash. She LOVES dog toys and is usually carrying one around in her mouth. This dog is an easy keeper and would do well with even a novice owner.        Her only issue is that some men make her nervous and that makes her submissively urinate. She loves my husband and she has not been afraid of any of the many of men who have befriended her at the local dog park.        She did not show any interest in the cats at the pet store during an adoption day. Her ideal home will have another playful dog to wrestle with her. Hazel is the sort of dog that you can take anywhere and she will make you proud to be attached to the other end of the leash. She does need to lose some weight and she has already lost five pounds. Be sure to take notice of the photo of her beautiful striped feet!      Approved adopters may contact Hazel's foster: gsdhouse@comcast.net

Call (916) 782-7722 x. 201 or (530) 885-7387 x. 201 or visit www.placerspca.org/snap.Who can resist Santos’ sad looking, expressive eyes and not fall in love? He is such a sweet boy looking for a home to call his own. This boy, according to his previous pet parents is house and crate trained. He has good leash manners and at seven years of age, all that rambunctiousness of a younger dog is gone and he may settle quickly in his new home. He hopes to be a true family member that is loved and cherished. He may do well in a quiet home where he can stay active with nice daily walks. Santos is rather selective with other dogs, so being the only dog in the home may be best for this sweet boy. School age children may be best around this loving man.All adoptions from the Placer SPCA include spay or neuter surgery, microchip, vaccinations, and a voucher for a free veterinary exam.

03/19/2016	Ryka 4203 - German Shepherd Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Sterling, VA	Female	"Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (medium coat). Please contact Alexandra and Jeff (gsdnest@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Meet Ryka! She is a stunning 3 year old red and black medium/long haired female GSD diva. She is an owner surrender for economic reasons. She is being spayed on 2/24 and will be available approximately two weeks after. She has a classic GSD form, the kind you see in silhouette on signs and t-shirts. With that lovely sloping hind-quarter comes a price, she is sadly destined for hip issues. She is not currently in pain, but will undoubtedly need treatment in the future. If you have small children or cats, this is not the dog for you. She is a herder and currently has the job of the fun police at our house... she is a toy hoarder and does not appreciate the other dogs playing with each other. We are working on changing this trait, but it is a slow process.  Ryka loves toys, she often carries one around. But she does not share well with her fellow canines. Her foster brother is trying to teach her how to play with other dogs, not just humans. She does love fetch, but will ""correct"" any interfering four legged rivals for the ball. She probably would do well as an only dog in an adult household. She is a people dog. She sleeps on your bed curled up in a ball and is quite velcro. She has had several accidents in our house as well having some in her temporary foster's home. I think most of the issues have been related to timing and diet issues, but she will require frequent potty breaks until she is settled in. She does have a sensitive tummy and is currently on a grain free diet with supplements and coconut oil. She has a beautiful coat and grooms well. She is not a fan of water, but bathes nicely. She accepts toe-nail trims without incident. She knows basic commands of sit, down, stay, wait, heel and more. She is wickedly smart and quite calm for the most part. She does need intellectual stimulation, she comes from working lines and would do well with some advanced training. She picks up new things very quickly. She is a counter surfer. We have yet to catch her in the act to correct her, but things have gone missing since she arrived and her reputation proceeded her. She has a very gentle jump up to greet (another thing we are working on!) and also has put her feet up on the washer ever so slyly, so I can only imagine her stealthy approach to sandwich-napping. She is vocal. She is crate trained, but will complain for a bit. I would say she has moderate separation anxiety. Upon returning home, she will tell you about her day and how much she missed you. We have yet to leave her with free roam during the day as we have three house dogs and do not want any trouble, but I would anticipate she would earn the privilege in her forever home... just make sure the temptations are put away and she has plenty of toys to chew!  Overall she is a wonderful dog. Approved adopters may contact her fosters at gsdnest@gmail.com.                "

03/19/2016	Bella - Doberman Pinscher Dog For Adoption	rescue	Doberman Pinscher	Bristolville, OH	Female	Posted Breed: Doberman Pinscher. Hey there! I'm Bella. I was found as a stray and I landed in a shelter. I spent some time in a foster home until Surprise! There were puppies. That's when me and my puppies came to Doberman Underground. My puppies have all found homes, and I've spent some time adjusting to normal life in a home.        I love people! They give me pets and pets. I like to lay my head on my foster mom's shoulder and curl up beside her on the couch. I do the head nudge under the arm if I think you're, uh hello, forgetting something like petting me. I enjoyed spending time with kids, but I would probably do better with kids over 10 years old. I sleep on a dog bed in my foster mom's bedroom at night.        I live in a foster home with 4 other dogs. I have 3 foster sisters and 1 foster brother. I get along with everyone because they're dobermans (like me) and a labrador. I must've had a bad experience with a German Shepherd in the past because I do not like them. I like to pick on my oldest foster sister but I take correction from her well. Occasionally my foster mom needs to get the squirt bottle out to tell me to settle down and leave her alone. My next older foster sister doesn't appreciate my antics sometimes but I just like everyone so much, I don't understand why she grumbles at me. All I want to do is lay down beside her and touch her.        I got really anxious after being separated from my puppies and having my big girl surgery. They got really worried because I was really stressed out and doing behaviors that could've really hurt myself. With the help of medicine my foster mom gets at wal-mart, I've stopped counter surfing and destroying things and can even stay in a crate for a short time as long as I know where Mom is. I've even been found taking a nap in there but not for too long. I'm told I'm a real Houdini because I've found a way to escape a crate and escape the kitchen even with really tall panels blocking me in. With the help of the medicine, I'm a good girl when my foster mom is at work spending the day out in the house with my foster labrador sister and not bothering anything in the house now.       If you have a cat, I'm not the dog for you. I become very obsessed with cats and birds because one of my foster homes had both of these and I was quite intent on them.        I would probably do better with another dog in my forever home. They would be a good companion for me when you have to go to work or run errands. I didn't like being separated from the other dogs and found a way to be with them when my foster mom left. I'd do better with dogs my size because I liked to chase the little foster brother that was here when I first arrived. But he ran like the wind and made it into a game. (My foster sister did it first, I was just following her lead. Oh it was a fun game.)       I need a physical fence because I'm interested in what's going on next door and have prey drive. I would be way too interested in next door and would forget all about boundaries.         I'd really like to bring someone some great companionship because I love spending time with people. I love the attention they give me. I like to nudge for more attention.        I hope I don't scare you off by telling you my story. I've made huge progress in the last 6 weeks. I'm fully vetted and I'd really like to find my own family to love me.       Applications can be submitted at www.dobermanunderground.org Please note, We are all volunteers and have jobs, families and pets of our own to care for as well as our foster dogs in our homes.

03/19/2016	Dinah Franklin - Shih Tzu Dog For Adoption	rescue	Shih Tzu	Pataskala, OH	Female	"Posted Breed: Shih Tzu. PLEASE NOTE:  If you are viewing this biography on a website other than the Ohio Fuzzy Pawz website, not all information transfers to partner websites in some instances. If you go to the individual webpage of our dogs, you will be able to get more information each dog.Dinah’s adoption donation is $225 and she is being fostered in Central Ohio. She has been spayed, microchipped, received her rabies, distemper/parvo, and bordetella vaccines, tested negative for heartworms and started on prevention. Dinah has also had a dental cleaning. Dinah came into rescue when her owner dumped her at a kill shelter in Central Ohio in a severely neglected, matted condition. She had a ruptured eye with deep corneal ulcer on the other eye. Dinah was in such extreme pain that she could not be fully examined at the shelter. Our volunteer took her immediately to the vet to get her on some pain medication so she could be more comfortable. Our vet also discovered that she had bladder stones and would require surgery for that as well. Once Dinah had her ruptured eye and bladder stones removed, she started to feel significantly better. Dinah has cleaned up very well and still needs to lose a couple pounds but is a different dog than what we pulled from the shelter. She is an approximately 8 year old Shih Tzu who loves to cuddle and be with her person. Dinah does require a special diet to help maintain her pH balance to further prevent bladder stones and she doesn’t have any problem with it. She thinks it’s delicious. Dinah does well on housetraining if kept on a schedule and would definitely benefit from someone who enjoys walking. She has been through a lot so a quieter home with no small children would be the best fit for her. Dinah has gotten a second chance and is taking full advantage of it and is relishing her new lease on life and she would love to find her forever person to help her enjoy it.  Visual breed identification in dogs can be unreliable so, in many cases, we are only guessing at the predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.   Our Adoption Process      The adoption process has several steps involved.  Please review prior to submitting an application. Our adoption process is detailed here:      http://www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/info/adoption Our volunteers work very diligently to process each application and we try to ensure that we are making the best match possible for each dog. We do not schedule meetings with dogs until an application has been approved. It can take up to a few weeks to process an application or as little time as a few days, from the time you submit an application, please be prepared to adopt as we cannot hold dogs. Special Requirements Some dogs may have special requirements (for example, medications, a fence) -- if you apply for a dog, please be sure to read over the biography completely to see if there are any special needs and if you're home would be suitable. If we indicate on the dog's biography that a fence is required, this means your home must have a physical fence. Other dogs may require a ""strong vet reference"" which indicates that we are looking for a home that has a documented history of veterinary care with previous pets.  The first step in our process is to submit an online adoption application at www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/forms. The application MUST include the personal references and veterinary, grooming, and landlord references (if applicable) and their respective contact information. If you do not include the references and the contact information, your application will be delayed as it CANNOT be processed. Once the references have been successfully completed, a home visit is then scheduled when a rescue representative can meet all members of the family or residents of the home. No application is approved prior to the home visit being done.  At that point, the Directors will discuss any and all applications on a foster dog and make a selection--in many cases, there are multiple applications for each dog, so please be understanding that our only priority is the successful placement of each of our foster dogs. Out of State Adoptions We do adopt out of state to outstanding applicants, however, our process requires a home visit, so out of state adoptions can take longer. We do not ship our dogs, adopters should be prepared to pick up the dog in Central Ohio.                "

03/19/2016	Smokey - Rhodesian Ridgeback / Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rhodesian Ridgeback	Sanford, FL	Female	"Posted Breed: Rhodesian Ridgeback / Terrier (short coat). 03/10/2016: Smokey is a sweet little girl who knows what she likes. She is good with some of our dogs and let's you know what she wants. Smokey likes to play and she is about 95% potty trained. Just when you think you heard it all, beautiful Smokey was found tied to a tree. Judy was notified and took this sweet girl in.  We are evaluating her since she is new to us. As we get more information regarding her behavior, potty training, likes and dislikes we will update her page.According to www.dogbreedinfo.com, the Rhodesian Ridgeback, originally from Zimbabwe, resulted from crosses between ridgebacked dogs originally kept by native tribes in South Africa and other breeds, such as the Khoikhoi dog, Mastiff, Deerhound and some breeds that are not known. It was the native Khoikhoi dog that gave the Ridgeback his distinctive reverse-hair coat marking, a dominant characteristic that today makes him unique among dog breeds. The ridgebacks were imported by Boer settlers in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its standard, fixed in Rhodesia, dates from 1922. The Rhodesian Ridgeback was used for many purposes. This impressive, protective hound could hunt game, retrieve, take care of children, and guard property. South African hunters discovered that the Ridgeback, used in packs, was very effective against lions, hence the breed's other name, the African Lion Hound. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is well adapted to the harsh African environment. He can withstand very high temperatures and the damp cold of night. It is insensitive to insect bites and can go without food and water for over 24 hours. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is ferocious in the hunt, but in the home it is a calm, gentle, obedient, good dog. Good-natured, but some do not do well with children because they do not want to be pestered or played with roughly. They are intelligent, cunning but straight-forward dogs that are loyal to the family, have something of a mind of their own, are brave, vigilant, reserved toward strangers, and possess considerable stamina. This breed needs thorough obedience training, socialization with people and other dogs, and firm owner leadership to become the excellent companion he can be. Ridgebacks react best to an extremely consistent and equable approach to training. They are intelligent and learn quickly, but they are also strong and a bit stubborn. Training should be gentle and start young while the dog is still small enough to manage. They are also very good watch dogs, but not suggested for guard dogs. They are very protective of owners! This has to be addressed during their early training. This breed can be more destructive than a Lab if left unsupervised! Do not overfeed this breed. Males may be combative with other dogs. Provided this dog meets cats and other pets when it is young, any potential problem will be prevented. Ridgebacks make excellent jogging companions. They have a life expectancy of about 10-12 years. The Terrier is a good-natured, amusing, extremely loyal and affectionate family pet, which is good with children and adults. Almost always obedient, it is always eager to please its master. It is an extremely courageous and intelligent guard dog that is very full of vitality. They are highly protective of their owners and the owner's property. It is usually very friendly, but has an uncanny ability to know when it needs to protect and when everything is okay. Excellent with children in the family, they have a high pain tolerance and will happily put up with rough child play. As with any breed, they should not be left alone with unfamiliar children. Used as all around working farm dogs, they were referred to as ""the poor mans horse"". They are strong and generally weigh between 40 and 70 lbs. They have a life expectancy of about 12 - 14 years.                "

03/19/2016	Joey Ramone - American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Staffordshire Terrier-Unknown Mix	Tonawanda, NY	Male	Posted Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Nice to meet you - my name is Joey Ramone. I was a stray to the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter and they took inspiration from my little Mohawk to give me a punk rock name. My full name is a little long, so my foster parents call me Joey, Jo Jo Bear, and Buddy Bear. I am an American Staffordshire Terrier, and am around 3 years old. My foster mom thinks I originally came from a loving home because I am a very confident boy, never and not at all shy or hesitant around new people. I aim to please and am so happy to hear what a good boy I’m being.  I am a perfect gentleman on a leash as long as I wear my prong collar. I am a chewer and require hard, durable toys, but I limit my chewing to toys only; I also tend to adopt one toy as my “security toy” and make sure I bring it with me everywhere in the house and to bed at night. I love to snuggle and am a very good cuddle buddy. I currently live with 2 foster sisters who I get along well with, but prefer to play by myself or with my humans. I am housebroken and crate trained, and behave very well around company.  Joey's adoption fee is $175 + $50 training deposit that is refunded upon proof of completion of an obedience course.All dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered.

03/19/2016	Skip of Edgewater, MD - American Eskimo Dog Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Eskimo Dog	Randallstown, MD	Male	Posted Breed: American Eskimo Dog. Meet Skip, Yes I am the one that was rescued from the Amish!!I was locked in a hutch of some sort as a guard dog to alert my owners of anyone coming onto the property. I lived this way for a long time. This nice lady came on her way home from work one day and bailed me out. Now I need a forever home. I am in the process of learning to live the real life with real humans. I have a few rough corners to work off but I am coming along very nicely. I am very smart and want to give love and be loved. For more information please contact Cheryl at  lovemy4eskies@gmail.com and fill out an adoption application at www.eskierescuers.orgUPDATE 9/12/2015: Skip has been in my home for 3 weeks and to date he has learned sit. He wants to jump on you all the time but we are working on off and sit and so far he is doing pretty good. Since skip has never lived in a home i have learned that he needs to be treated like a puppy from housebreaking to training. He seems to be a really sweet dog and loves loves loves to snuggle. He would do best in a single family home with a fenced yard and with one other dog that may play with him but he would also do okay as the only dog so he would get ALL the attention. I think with the right home and training he will be a great dog. I think a home with older kids would be okay but maybe age 10 and older. . I love this little guy but he needs someone who can give him the world So please consider adopting skip of maryland.  Whenever possible Eskie Rescuers United tries to adopt out its dogs locally (or at least to adopters in adjoining states to where I'm being fostered). Please note that ERU processes LOCAL adoption applications before considering those from out of state. If I'm not local to you, as explained above, and you really have your heart set on me, you will have to make special arrangements so ERU can get me to you safely (for example, flying me to you at your own expense, or paying a transport group to drive me to you). Note: We may ask that you to make a donation to cover transport costs if the distance is great and we have trouble finding transport drivers.There is an adoption fee required; and, please be aware, Eskie Rescuers United will not adopt out its dogs as outdoor dogs.

Santino is a high energy, loving dachshund who is approximately 4 years old.  Santino has behavioral issues that require a structured home with a firm owner and no children. Santino needs the commitment from someone who will love him unconditionally and accept his tendency to behave unpredictably; creating an environment that will ensure Santino’s safety and the safety of others. Santino started on a trial of Fluoxetine (Prozac) which has been helping with his behavioral / anxiety issues, and it will be recommended to keep him on this medication long term.

If you're interested in adopting any SGSR dog, please read about our Adoption Process and fill out an Adoption Application. Visit our website for more information, including Frequently Asked Questions.     ~~Hello! My name is Bert and I'm a gentle giant whom enjoys observing the world from my dog bed. I'm an older guy, so I move on the slow side and try to stay out of my foster siblings way. Talking about siblings, I live with 5 other fur-blings and get to meet new ones on a daily basis! I love all other dogs, large and small, and cats. I'm not sure how I do with human kids, but my foster-mom thinks I will do well with young and older kids since I'm really laid back. I enjoy walks and food, but I was told that I'm on the heavy side so I get to enjoy one more-so than the other. When I first meet you I'm kind of shy and will need a few days to adjust. I was dumped with my brother after 7 years in one household, so I hope you understand that I'm a little gun shy when claiming you as my own family. Once I understand that I'm yours forever, I'll shower you with all the German Shepherd love that I could possibly offer. Hope you consider me as a potential family member of your home! I am being fostered in Richlands, NC. Please fill out an adoption application at southeastgermanshepherdrescue.com.

Tobias was a ""puppy mill"" breeding dog for the first 3 years of his life. He is a sweet boy but he just does not like the other 2 dogs in his current home.

Joey was rescued from the Roswell Animal Shelter at the last minute. He is around 3-4 years old. He is quiet and sweet. Housetrained, good with dogs, cats, and kids.  It has taken Joey a long time to learn that people aren't all that bad, but he is still a little nervous around new people. He doesn't have an aggressive bone is his body, but he does need someone who will be patient and slow with him. He is playful but also very calm...and once you have his trust, he will never leave your side! We are not sure what all he is a mix of. He is taller than a chihuahua. We are trying to figure out where those spots come from. Chinese Crested Dogs have these spots and Italian Greyhounds also have spots but to a lesser degree. He also doesn't have any hair on his chest it is absolutely smooth. And either chihuahua or rat terrier mixed in with this. Contact Trish at 505-907-3791 or email pacatrish@yahoo.com

Black Eyed Pea is my name and Tug-O-War is my game. I’m a 4 year old female Pit Mix that is house trained. I am a really muscular 80 pound girl that likes to give slobbery kisses. I have a lot of energy and love to play and run! After I expend some energy I am pretty content to just hang out and relax. When it is time to sleep I go right into my kennel and sleep through the night without a peep. I’m not at all particular about my human friends though probably would do better with older children since I'm FULL of energy. If my new family has dogs i would love to have a proper introduction to get to know them. Haven't met a cat yet but don't think I would like those furry creatures. If you are interested in meeting me contact Unleashed to setup a meet and greet!   ***Check out my Facebook page!*** https://www.facebook.com/AdoptBlackEyedPea

03/19/2016	Frosty of Greenbelt, MD - American Eskimo Dog Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Eskimo Dog	Randallstown, MD	Male	Posted Breed: American Eskimo Dog. Please Note: This animal is listed as a courtesy to another organization or individual. Please be sure to contact the foster/caretaker for more information about him/her.Meet Frosty!  This handsome boy undoubtedly had a rough start in life as he was a stray, but he was fortunate to end up with PAW.  Frosty really wants a person to call his own and he will benefit greatly from an experienced dog owner who will give him lots of attention and exercise, as well as continue with his training. Frosty gets a bit anxious in new situations so his new family will need to be patient and give him time to acclimate.  Frosty loves to run in his foster's fenced yard and go for long walks. While outdoors, he will alert you to passing cats and squirrels, however he is quiet in the home.  Ideally, Frosty would love to be the center of your world, however another dog in the home may be okay. He is currently living with a foster brother and they get along fine.  No cats or kids for Frosty (older teens okay).  Frosty is house trained and crate trained. If you are interested in meeting Frosty, or for more information about him or any other of the wonderful PAW dogs, contact us at pawdogs@yahoo.com.  Sorry but we can only consider applications within a two hour driving distance of DC.

Please contact Cheryl (lovemy4eskies@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Hi my name is Toby, I am about 9 years old and I was picked up as a stray by the local animal control management facility. I was in there for a couple days when I had a visitor. She stayed a little while then I heard her say ifI did not find a home by the end of the weekend she would come back and get me. As you can see she kept her word and came for me. I am currently living with 3 fur sisters and 1 fur brother. I get along fine with them. I actually ignore them because I don't think they really like me being there. I am up to date on all shots and have been recently neutered.  I hardly bark and I do have some resource guarding issues and do not like to be pushed out of the way or picked up. My foster mommy also believes that I may be deaf or just like most boys have selective hearing. I recently went to a party where there were tons of other dogs and I had no problem hanging with my foster mom and people coming up to her and petting me so I don’t seem to have issues with guarding my human. I do not think I should be placed in a family with small children due to my resource guarding and I would be okay with another dog in the home but may not really play with them so I think I would be ok if I was the only dog. If you had the time, love and patience to work with me I will make someone a really good boy. I do not know commands so I think my prior home just never worked with me so will you be that person to make me the best I can be or to just learn to love me the way I am and provide me a furever home. If you have any questions please email my mommy at lovemy4eskies@gmail.com.

Snickers is a sweet girl with a story. She was adopted with her pal from a shelter only to be dumped out in a rural ranch area. The two of them set out on the long trek home. By the time they were discovered and picked up by rescue, they were tired, hungry and unsure of themselves. Snickers' traveling companion was also sick. After rounds of testing, it was determined that he had valley fever. He did not make it through, and Snickers was to endure one more blow.

03/19/2016	Kody of  Waynesville, NC - American Eskimo Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Eskimo Dog	Randallstown, MD	Male	"Posted Breed: American Eskimo Dog (medium coat). Woof, Y'all! I'm Kodiak, but my friends call me ""Kody."" I am almost 7 years old. I hit a few bumps in the road in my midlife and found myself in an urban Atlanta, GA shelter. I was pretty grumpy while I was in that loud, scary, stinky place. Who could blame me? I didn't like it there. That, and the fact that I tested positive for Heartworms, made me not so attractive to potential adopters. I waited and no one came for me.   Finally, when my days were almost up, my nice kennel attendant told me that someone from something called a rescue was going to come for me. Someone drove from a place called North Carolina to pick me up. I was glad to be out of the shelter but a bit unsure about everything that was happening to me.   I'm now safe in a foster home, thanks to something called Eskimo Rescuers United, and I'm settling right in. I'm getting along great with my foster sisters and brothers. I have 4 doggie, 3 kitty siblings and one Guinea Pig . They are all my friends. I play with the dogs and ignore everyone else, really. I like my foster mommy and daddy and give them lots of kisses. I also like to steal mom's chair when she gets up to do something. I feel like I'm right at home here. I want to be right with my people all of the time.   I went to see someone called ""the vet"" and he said that I appear to be very healthy. I wasn't very happy to see the vet because they were doing some pretty ""personal"" stuff, like nail trimming, looking in my ears and eyes, taking my temperature, and even x-rays. I was a little growly so my mom said to put me in a muzzle for everyone's safety. Well, that sucked, but we got everything done. I'm glad that's over. Mom said we will have to do it again, but, it will be a while. Good.   I have started my treatment for Heartworms. I take my pills in Pill Pockets, with no fuss. It's going to take some time, but, I hope those things are gone soon. I don't have any signs of them right now and my foster mom says that's a good thing and she is grateful for that. I guess that means I am, too. We are using the ERU Gentle Treatment Protocol and not that scary Immeticide. You can find more information on the Gentle Protocol here: http://www.eskierescuers.org/info/display?PageID=11624.   I have good house manners. I sleep and eat in my crate. I am house trained. I will bark at strangers in the house or around the car, but, I love people and enjoy meeting new folks when out on a walk, at the doggie park, etc. I used to go to doggie daycare with my previous family and really liked that. I'm really nervous around small kids. My foster mom says that the best home for me will have no small children. 12 and over would be best. She also says that I would do well with moderately active adults that have experience with dogs. I wouldn't mind the occasional hike or to do some type of fun activities with my folks. I am pretty well behaved on a leash and know some basic commands: sit, come, kennel. I really am a good boy and want to find my forever family.   Could that be you? If you think so, please fill out an adoption application at: http://eru.rescuegroups.org/forms/form_humanverify?formid=327 and someone will contact you about me.

03/19/2016	Sula - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Peoria, AZ	Female	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Meet Sula! She is a Pit Bull who came to us from the County shelter after spending over a year there due to a Ã¢ÂÂCourt HoldÃ¢ÂÂ. Her owner did not receive rights to get her back, so the shelter contacted us to see if we could help. At the time of her rescue, Sula had been rapidly losing weight and had little to no interest in interacting with humans after spending over one year in a kennel. She was diagnosed by our vet with something called Shadow Chasing; a form of OCD in dogs where they become obsessed with a certain behavior and repeat it over and over Ã¢ÂÂ in SulaÃ¢ÂÂs case it was watching shadows and lights. Sula was also diagnosed with moderate heartworm a few months after she came into our care, but was treated successfully, is healthy now, and has been able to return to normal exercise and activity.   Sula is around 3-4 years old now. She is spayed, crate-trained, microchipped, current on vaccinations, and walks well on a leash (with a little pulling). She does okay with other dogs her size but like all of our Paws, she requires a dog introduction with any new potential four-legged family members. Since she has been in our care in her foster home she has made a complete 180 from when we first got her- she rarely displays the shadow chasing behavior anymore and has become much more attached to humans- she likes to interact, listen, receive treats, and get pets. To learn more about this sweet girl, email us at thelostpaws@gmail.com                
03/19/2016	Peppermint Patty - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Peoria, AZ	Female	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed. This beautiful mama dog was abandoned in a trailer park in one of the areas where we flier for our spay/neuter clinics. Some neighbors told us about how her owner left her and her puppies behind (who were just days old), and they were not sure how to care for her & the puppies. Lost Paws took her in and soon found out that she had a severe case of Tick Fever and may possibly have Lupus. Since then, she has been on medication and is doing much better. Peppermint Patty is ready for adoption. She is a sweet girl who likes to explore her yard and sunbathe, or nap inside. Our vet guesses she is only about 2 years old. She is a Cattle Dog mix. Peppermint Patty is now crate-trained, potty-trained, and is working on learning basic commands. Email thelostpaws@gmail.com for more information.                
03/19/2016	Mariah - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Peoria, AZ	Female	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Mariah was found tied to a tree in a parking lot in the summer heat with her puppy Leilani (who has since been adopted) tied next to her. The person who found them took them to the vet and paid to have their shots done, for Mariah's spay and boarded them there for about a week before Lost Paws took them in. Mariah is a very sweet mellow girl who loves to go for walks, hikes and car rides. She's very smart and knows several tricks. She is crate trained, house broken, spayed, microchipped and current on vaccinations. Mariah is probably around 3 years old. She would do great in a family with kids, but no cats. Mariah would do okay with another dog that is not dominate or high energy, but would be just fine being the only pet, too. She can be active for walks but would prefer being a couch potato.

Ben's favorite activities are: belly rubs, ""working"" for treats or praise, running through the sprinklers, hikes, long walks, and laying on the couch. Ben would prefer an adult only home where's he's the only pet. Older children who are experienced with large dogs would be fine, too. Unfortunately, he does not like kitties or other dogs. Ben likes to be apart of his people's life, so being home alone for long periods of time would not be an ideal home for him. Because he is so smart, he would make an excellent working dog.

He loves his toys and will gladly show them off to you. He is crate trained and housebroken and has already been through basic training and was an excellent student! After all he's been through, he would prefer to be the only pet in the home and would do best with older children rather than younger. He loves to go on walks, play in the kiddie pool on hot days and is very loyal. If you'd like to meet this handsome boy, please email us at thelostpaws@gmail.com                
03/19/2016	Stella - German Shepherd Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Morrisville, NC	Female	"Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (medium coat). If you're interested in adopting any SGSR dog, please read about our Adoption Process and fill out an Adoption Application. Visit our website for more information, including Frequently Asked Questions.      Meet Stella! She is super sweet, obedient, gentle and loving. She excites easily, but also corrects easily when she is level-headed. She is crate-trained and knows "" sit"", ""down"", ""stay"", and ""shake"", and ""go home"" (to crate) on command. She walks great on a leash and is well-behaved in public. She loves car rides and, at dog parks, she loves to be chased. She is a fast runner and likes to herd other dogs. She really (REALLY) loves a good run. She can run three miles with no problem...and could do more. She received glowing reports after going to doggie day care. She loves attention and would be best in a house with a family that has plenty of space for her to run and play. The family needs to love to exercise, run, and give her a mental workout with training. She would be an amazing agility dog or some other type of active job after further obedience training . She is great with dog-savvy children, including toddlers, of all ages. She is fine with other dogs until she becomes comfortable with them, then she tends to be a bully, so a home with no other pets is best. She has attended several SGSR meet and greet events and did great with dogs at both events! Stella lived with a shy cat who kept her distance, but she will chase, so cats are probably not a good idea. Stella is a petite gal (about 50 pounds), is about 4 years old, spayed and up to date on all vaccinations and being fostered in Virginia Beach, VA, by one of our professional trainers. If you think yours is the ""forever"" home for sweet Stella, please contact your adoption coordinator or submit an adoption application at our website,    www.southeastgermanshepherdrescue.com     Our adoption process consists of a telephone interview, a call to your veterinarian and a home visit. If you have any questions about the adoption process please contact sgsrescue@gmail.com .                "

03/19/2016	Creasy - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Peoria, AZ	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. CREASY Meet Creasy Bear Ã¢ÂÂ this handsome boy came to us from the County shelter along with his Ã¢ÂÂsisterÃ¢ÂÂ Sula after being at the shelter for over a year due to being on a Ã¢ÂÂCourt HoldÃ¢ÂÂ. His old owner did not receive rights to get him back, so County called us and asked us to help. The last few months of his stay at the shelter, Creasy had been losing weight and was having episodes of what seemed to be seizures. Our vet checked him out and found nothing neurological with him, although he did have some breathing issues and coughing. A few weeks later, he was diagnosed with severe heartworm. He was treated with medication and a series of injections successfully, and after being with Lost Paws for over a year, he is heartworm free! Creasy still has some issues with breathing after a heavy play session or on hikes, so his activity needs to be monitored Ã¢ÂÂ but other than that he is doing great and is healthy and happy! Creasy is neutered, current on vaccinations, and microchipped. He is crate-trained and likes to play with his foster sister. We believe he would do best in a home without cats (or birds) due to his prey drive. He is probably around 5-6 years old. He enjoys car rides and getting pets from people. We would love nothing more than for this boy, who has been through so much, to get a second chance at a happy family life. For more information or to set up a meet & greet with this lovable boy, email us at thelostpaws@gmail.com.

WE CANNOT RESPOND TO GENERAL INQUIRES ABOUT A DOG WITHOUT AN APPLICATION ON FILE.   Our Sasha, a 4-1/2 yr old tri-colored Woolly Husky/Malamute, is an owner surrender. She was doing well in her prior home until there was a fire which caused her family to have to kennel her while their home was rebuilt. Separation from her family along with being in a kennel took its toll on her. She became sad and depressed.  Since arriving in foster care, Sasha has come back to life! She enjoys playing with her foster pack. She is small dog, cat and kid friendly. Because of her size it would be best to home her with a medium to large dog for a playmate. Sasha is well aware of her size, making every attempt not to knock anything over, however because of this, small children are not recommended.  Sasha knows basic commands come like sit, lay down and leave it. She is also leash trained, doesn't pull and enjoys going on long walks with her foster parents. Due to her kennel experience, she is unable to be crated but possibly over time and trust. There is a crate made available to her. Many nights she sleeps in it with the door open when there is not enough room in her foster parent’s bed. Sasha has been left uncrated with her foster pack with no damage to the home. She is not destructive when left for short amounts of time. In true husky fashion she can be a counter surfer so secure your food. A fenced yard would be best for her to play ball and play tag with her friends, these are her favorite games, next to removing squeakers from toys. Please note she is also a great dog park candidate. She requires weekly grooming. Please consider opening your home to this sweet, gentle, loving giant....who although only weighs 60lbs, is a tall girl. She is blossoming more and more everyday....be the last stop of her journey. She is currently in foster in DE but can be transported to MD or NJ.Adoption Application http://www.thelastresortrescue.com/adoptionapplication.htm

If you're in a hurry and need to take the car, Brock would be happy with that too! In the home, Brock is calm, and pretty much a house trained lazy kind of guy, but can also be a great watchdog. He tolerates baths, but may try to hide if he see's the ""It's bath time"" lol! Brock like to walk around the house with his leash in his mouth, and has a favorite bone he likes to chew on and play with.  We are looking for a Family for Brock that will enroll him in a training class. Although he may not know many commands, he is a great dog in the home!  Because of his size, we are asking for a home WITHOUT CHILDREN, and would prefer NO OTHER ANIMALS IN THE HOME. His adoption fee is $300, and includes neuter, up to date vaccinations, dewormer, flea and heartworm preventative, microchip, and and a very handsome Brock!

We do not fly or use transport companies. Our adoption fee is $150.00 for mixed breed puppies and adult dogs, $225.00 for full blooded puppies and adult dogs and $50.00 for cats and kittens. Regardless if the animal is a mixed breed or full blooded they are spayed/neutered prior to adoption IF they are old enough. If they are too young at the time of adoption, then it is your financial responsibility to spay/neuter the pet by the age of 6 months and you must provide proof for our files that it has been done. All of our pets are checked by a vet, given the shots appropriate for their age and any other treatment deemed necessary by the vet. All of our pets are adopted as indoor pets and are not be outdoors tied to a box 24/7. The pet you are adopting has been living in a home with a foster family. You are expected to take possession of the pet you are applying for within a few days of application approval. This will enable us to accept another pet into that home. Because we are a rescue, and believe that spaying and neutering is crucial in stopping the reproduction of unwanted puppies/kittens and massive amounts of animals dying daily in shelters across the country, we expect any animal already in your home to be spayed/neutered. If for any reason you are unable to keep the pet you have adopted you are required to return them to Pet Helpers, Inc. They are not to be sold or given away.   Check us out on Facebook!!!!!!

03/19/2016	Aria *adoption pending - Rottweiler (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler	Forest, VA	Female	Posted Breed: Rottweiler (short coat). Aria is an energetic, intelligent, lovable dog who is highly motivated to please and learn. She is an 85 pound, 4 year old Rottweiler. We are unsure how she is with other animal as their is no other resident animal in the current home. Several years ago she was bit by another dog at a dog park and the owner says she is uncomfortable since. We think with a proper introduction and guidance she may adapt to a home with another dog. She is an indoor family pet, adores kids, and is house trained.   Aria  is around 18 4 years and her adoption fee is 200 which covers the following: spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm testing, dhp/p, rabies, bordatella (agre appropriate vaccines), deworming, and all the care he received while with CVRR. All animals are on flea and tick and parasite prevention for the duration in fostercare. We are an volunteer group, who process the applications so please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks, follow-up questions.  You can expedite the process by providing accurate phone and email addresses for all your references. Time to make phone calls is limited and we often have multiple applications in process .  We make every effort to move through them as quickly as possible. When your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if the dog picks you too. If it seems that the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee and an adoption contract to be signed. The adoption fees help cover a portion of the care provided to the animals. All dogs and pups are microchipped and all animals adopted out are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. **All of our animals have a lifetime commitment. If for any reason, the adoption does not work out, the cats and dogs are to come back to CVRR, which is a NO kill rescue.*** The foster family and the rescue volunteers will choose the new home based on the best fit for the dog/cat.

Hi! My name is Bodie. I'm a big boy.I was adopted out to a great family, but unfortunately, life situations sometimes change and I had to be returned.My previous foster mommy was a professional Dog Trainer! That's right ladies and gents and I was trained to be the absolute best boy I can be! I have great leash manners and have a rock solid ""sit"", ""down"", ""wait"", ""paw"", and ""target"". I have not been with my foster Mom for over a year now and because my adopters didnt have enough time to work with me, I do some patience and a refresher course on some od my manners. I do like to do a bit of running and playing but I'm not very high energy. I mostly chew my daily bone and catch naps on the sofa. Would you please consider giving me a chance? I'm ready for endless belly rubs if you're up for the gig!I used to sleep every night with one of my human siblings and i really miss her.i must be the only pet in the home.I am house trained but I do need some work on learning to be crated.

03/19/2016	Koda - Siberian Husky (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Siberian Husky	Hewitt, NJ	Male	Posted Breed: Siberian Husky (medium coat). www.TheLastResortRescue.com PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET THE FIRST STEP IS TO FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION AVAILABLE AT THELASTRESORTRESCUE.COM. WE CANNOT RESPOND TO GENERAL INQUIRES ABOUT A DOG WITHOUT AN APPLICATION ON FILE.   This large and in charge guy is Koda! Koda comes to TLR from a high kill shelter in GA where he ended up in the wrong hands. You see he was adopted by a family who didn’t understand the Siberian Husky breed and thought he was simply stunning. Well he is! But there is more to a Husky than meets the eye. As gorgeous and charming as they are, they are equally as stubborn, demanding and have a special set of needs. If you are a savvy Husky owner then Koda is your guy! But he is not for first time Husky owners. Koda is 3 years old and he is a big boy, weighing in at 85lbs! He could definitely use some exercise and believe it or not, likes to play ball! Koda doesn’t realize he’s approaching adult hood and likes to verbalize everything – he’s very talkative with his woo-woos. He’s also a mouthy guy in a playful, but gentle way. Koda arrived to his foster home in NC where he’ll stay until adopted. We are able to transport him to our MD or NJ locations for an approved adopter. True to the breed he’s a finicky eater and we haven’t quite figured out what his dish of choice is, but we will! He’s house broken and has had no potty accidents, he’s crate trained, he loves all humans alike and gets along well with the other dogs. He’s a playful guy, but in between his spurts he chills out and has a mellow disposition. Koda will require a secure fence, preferably 5 ft+ in height. He loves to run and play in the yard. If your yard isn’t very big, that’s okay because he’s a great dog park candidate. Koda is up to date on his vaccines, neutered and a healthy boy. His smile and sparkle in his eyes will bring joy into your home!Adoption Application http://www.thelastresortrescue.com/adoptionapplication.htm

Please contact SSRR (rottie.info.ssrr@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.                        SSRR provides FREE transport to our approved adopters.             Meet Beyla Bear! Beyla was raised by a loving person since she was 12 weeks old. Her owner recently died and trusted an SSRR volunteer with finding his beloved girl a great family.       This 5-year-old, pure-blooded beauty loves to play, go for walks and give kisses. She is house and crate trained and eagerly listens to all commands. Beyla is your typical rottie: enjoys exercise, demonstrates high intelligence and believes laps are for sitting.       Beyla loves to chase anything that moves, including leaves, making her not a good match for cats or small dogs. Since her human has been ill for a few years, Beyla is working on socialization and meeting new dogs slowly. She previously had a large male dog stay in her home and loved rough housing with him. She adores every human and wags her entire body when her foster parents come home or enter the room.       Although this girl is a little confused as to why she’s left the only home she's known, she is adjusting well to life with human children and other dogs. Due to her size and excitability Beyla would do best in a home with children over 12 and only those who have been taught to respect dogs. Beyla is microchipped, up-to-date on all vaccines; she has been well cared for as evident in all her vet records.        Only applicants in the Houston, TX, and surrounding areas will be considered for Miss Beyla.                    Step 1:  Please complete the adoption application in full; incomplete applications WILL NOT BE PROCESSED        Step 2: Our Lead Adoption Coordinator will contact you and confirm your application has been received (please use our   Contact Us form     if you have not gotten a response within 7 days).          Step 3: After you have received confirmation from our Lead Adoption Coordinator, your application will then be forwarded to communicate with one of our Adoption Coordinators. The Adoption Coordinator is your point of contact during the adoption process,        Step 4: Once the Adoption Coordinator has finished processing your application, a volunteer will be selected to contact you to schedule a home visit. Home visits allow us to see where the dog will live, discuss any questions you have and review our adoption contract.        Step 5: Once the application process is completed, the adoption package goes to the board of directors for a 24 hour review.        SSRR is very serious about the homes our dogs are placed in and want to ensure they never end up homeless again.

Adoption fee: $425.00We are a Wisconsin state licensed dog rescue -WI# 402433   ***We do not have a central adoption center at this time. All our dogs are in private foster homes within WI.

Our Weight Classes are as follows: 0- 25lbs - Small 26- 45lbs - Medium 46-89 - Large 90+ X-large If you are adopting an adult dog, which we consider 6 months of age or older, your adoption fee includes the following:  Spay/Neuter, Rabies and Distemper shots, dewormed, flea & tick preventative, heartworm tested and microchipped.  If you are adopting a dog younger than 6 months of age, the dog will be up to date on the shots as per the dogs age. The dog will be dewormed, flea/tick preventative and microchipped. We only spay/neuter our dogs by 6 months of age. If you decide to adopt a younger dog than 6 months of age, they will need to be spayed/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This will be determined by your contract along with the month they should have their surgery. This is included in your adoption fee.  Once you are approved with our rescue, you can meet any one of our dogs within the fosters home. If you are interested in the dog you met, you can take the dog home under our mandatory foster to adopt program. You receive 5 days to see if the dog is the right fit for your home.  If it is, we will conduct the home visit and finalize adoption. If it is not, it is returned to the foster. We are happy to find you another dog that meets your needs in your home.  If a dog is listed as PENDING, a family has met the dog and planning on adopting the dog after the home visit has been conducted. We always suggest sending in an application for a dog because there are times where the dogs are given back to us under the foster to adopt program. There are many reasons dogs are returned but normally it just was not the right fit for all.Please go to WWW.TAILWAGGERS911.COM under HOW TO ADOPT .

There are many reasons, besides our size, that us Great Danes are considered “great”.  I, for instance, am a great companion. I'm strikingly attractive, lovable, don't need a lot of grooming, and I’m happy to be a couch potato most of the time. I do get excited at walk time so I might pull a little on the leash, but just make it clear that you're the boss and I'll try my best to walk nicely. I’m a loving companion and will get attached to people that I get to know well. I love attention so much that I’ll compete for affection if another pet or child is around. For that reason, it's best that I go to a home where it’s just my best friend and I. If you feel I'd fit perfect into your life then please visit me! I'd love to finally find that forever home.

You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.   You can also read our adoption tips page for hints and helps on adopting a rescued dog. http://www.carolinapoodlerescue.org/AdoptionTips.shtml or for general information on Carolina Poodle Rescue, please visit our FAQs - http://www.carolinapoodlerescue.org/FAQGeneral.shtml                "
03/19/2016	Hoss 16 - Boxer Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Phoenix, AZ	Male	"Posted Breed: Boxer. Big, goofy, fun loving boy, that's Hoss. He loves leisurely walks (and we do mean leisurely). He knows some basic commands but his favorite command is too just chill and bask in the sun. Hoss is crate trained, is easily corrected and would do fantastic as an only dog since he is a bit too loving of his ""toys"". Looking for a great, affectionate and awesome companion? Hoss could fit that bill easily.                "
03/19/2016	Dallas - Hound / Mastiff / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mastiff-Unknown Mix	Hillsdale, IN	Male	Posted Breed: Hound / Mastiff / Mixed (short coat). Dallas, Virginia and Koko were brought to the shelter when the VCSD responded to an animal neglect report. They found Dallas and Virginia chained inside a small shed and Koko chained up on the back porch. All of the dogs were underweight with no food or water. Happily, they were recently released for adoption and are now available! Virginia has gone home and Koko is still looking for her family.Dallas is 3 years old and weighs 84 lbs. He is up to date on vaccines and is now neutered. He is a big goofy guy who loves to play with Virginia in the play yard and 'chase the cars' as they go past. He would do best in a fenced yard due to his game of chasing vehicles. He would be fine to go to a home with children. Due to Dallas' desire to chase moving objects, we don't believe he would be suited for a home with cats.Dallas was adopted into a home into a home with two other dogs. He did wonderful in the house, is pottytrained (!) and thinks he is a big lap dog. Unfortunately, he and the other large dog in the home (a female) fought over food and Dallas came back to the shelter. The family had gotten so attached to him they cried when they brought him back and begged us to find him a good home as an only dog. We promised we would! Come meet this gorgeous, loving, sweet boy today and give him a permanent home. He has been through so much! Unless otherwise stated, the adoption fee for dogs over 4 months is $120.00. Puppies under 4 months are $140.00 The adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, microchip, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy is that all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter. Our shelter is open to the public on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 1:00 pm until 5:00 pm and other times by appointment. If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com. To apply to adopt, you may download an adoption application from the Applications and Fees tab on our website. The web address is www.pvchs.cfsites.org. Please email the completed application to pvchs@joink.com.                
03/19/2016	Camille - Mastiff (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mastiff	Edmond, OK	Female	"Posted Breed: Mastiff (short coat). PLEASE NOTE: GPMR communicates primarily by email. If you have any questions regarding one of our Mastiffs, please read their bio and if you still have questions- drop us an email at info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.org . If you have questions about our adoption procedures, please go to our Pages of Interest on the left hand column under ""Adoption Info."" We answer email inquiries almost immediately-usually always within a few hours and phone calls are returned with 24-36 hours.    GPMR does not have a shelter. All of our dogs are kept in loving foster homes. We must have a completed adoption application on file before meeting any of our mastiffs.     GPMR adopts to the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana and parts of Colorado.  !!!Any mastiffs being adopted out of the state of Oklahoma require a health certificate to be paid for by the adopter!!!          Meet Camille! She is a super sweet girl who came to GPMR when her owner could no longer keep her. Camille will be 3 in April. She is currently being fostered wtih another Mastiff and they do well together. She also does great with cats. Since we don't know Camille's history, a home with older kids or just adults would probably be best.Camille is crate trained, and housebroken. Her fosters are working on training and she knows how to sit on command and most of the time shake. She loves the back yard. A house with a fenced in backyard would be best for her. She loves to lay down in the grass and run around. While Camille has done great with the Mastiff at her foster home, she does have issues meeting new dogs on leash so we're getting her some training to help with that. Her adopters will need to be willing to continue the training we've started so she can be the best Mastiff she can be!  Save a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!                "

03/19/2016	Ammo - Great Dane (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Great Dane	PIPE CREEK, TX	Male	Posted Breed: Great Dane (short coat). Please contact JoEllen (sagdinfo@aol.com) for more information about this pet.Go to www.texasgreatdane.org and use the online application form!!Meet Ammo! He is a 3 year old, neutered male, harlequin great dane. He came to us via seizure after his owners moved out of their house and left him and 3 other friends behind.  Ammo has been with us a few months and NONE of us can figure out why! The best we can guess is that we wrote his bio immediately on his entering foster care and didn't update it as he mellowed out. Since entering foster care this guy has mellowed tremendously. He pretty much gets along with everyone. Though small and fuzzy dogs will not be a great fit for his companion. He'd love a nice 30# and larger friend though! Ammo has been very chill about his foster moms niece who has visited multiple times and he LOVES to sneak kisses onto her face! He has become kennel trained, and he also walks well on leash and is quite social after spending so much time going to our weekly events meeting TONS of new dogs and people. Cats are probably a no go for him though we have not formally cat tested him.  Ammo's adoption fee is $500.00 and goes to cover the vetting he has received. He is neutered, fully vaccinated, microchipped gastropexied to prevent torsion and heart worm negative. Now all he needs is someone to love him as much as he will love them! If you are interested invading Ammo to your family please go to www.texasgreatdane.org and fill out the application there.

03/19/2016	Silver - Yellow Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Amory, MS	Male	Posted Breed: Yellow Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat).                 
03/19/2016	Apollo - German Shepherd Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Forest, VA	Male	"Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (medium coat). For a very long time I only saw  Apollo at adoption events. He was stiff and nervous and obviously out of his element. Amanda, his foster mom watched his body language, kept him focused on her and doing tricks  for food, and when he had enough, she would quietly make her exit. It was hard  for me to imagine him as the goofy, calm, loyal dog she would describe to me in our late night texting conversations. Then Christmas came and  Apollo needed a place to wait  for Santa Claus whi le his foster family was out of town. I was blown away by his manners, his easy going attitude, and his warm and lovable demeanor.   Ok. He isn't perfect. On leash with no ability to flee, he can be a touch snappy if cornered....but beyond that I really just adore this guy. No cats or small kids (cats are toys apparently and kids.... Well just to be extra safe) but shepherd lovers, believe me. ... He is worth a second look. Recently he has been learning to PLAY with people... This from his foster mom... ""So I don't have any other people who would really appreciate the significance of this - but  Apollo is learning how to play with people. He's always played so nicely with dogs and loved it, but when Ryan or I would play with Max, he would just look on. He tried to play  for the first time a few months ago, but he came up to Ryan and growled at him, so Ryan backed off to give him space. We didn't realize until afterward that he was probably just trying to participate.  He didn't try again  for a while, but he's really smart, so he just watched us play with Max. He's finally come back around to realizing that if he growls we'll stop, but if he frolics and opens his mouth a tiny bit and kind of butts it sideways against your hand or thigh he gets to play. He still doesn't really get what Max does to play with us (Max has several very involved games he plays that Pollo is still trying to figure out), but he's developing his own version, which is really big  for him.  He's also coming around to the idea that if he has a ball and he wants us to throw it, he can't put his face down on it or we won't take it. He's getting to where if he wants us to, he'll look away so it's clear we're allowed to throw it  for him.  It's not big  for most dogs, but it's really big  for him. He is learning that his more aggressive dog-play manners aren't going to work with people with less protective fur and is slowly adjusting to a more gentle/less scary-faced people version. Just wanted to brag on the big goob a little      Apollos around 3 and his adoption fee is 175 which covers the following: spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm testing, dhp/p, rabies, bordatella (agre appropriate vaccines), deworming, and all the care he received while with CVRR. All animals are on flea and tick and parasite prevention for the duration in fostercare. We are an volunteer group, who process the applications so please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks, follow-up questions.  You can expedite the process by providing accurate phone and email addresses for all your references. Time to make phone calls is limited and we often have multiple applications in process .  We make every effort to move through them as quickly as possible. When your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if the dog picks you too. If it seems that the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee and an adoption contract to be signed. The adoption fees help cover a portion of the care provided to the animals. All dogs and pups are microchipped and all animals adopted out are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. **All of our animals have a lifetime commitment. If for any reason, the adoption does not work out, the cats and dogs are to come back to CVRR, which is a NO kill rescue.*** The foster family and the rescue volunteers will choose the new home based on the best fit for the dog/cat.

Name: CharlieBreed: Labrador Retriever/Greater Swiss Mtn. Dog mix (best guess)Approximate Age: 3 yearsApproximate Weight: 65 lbs. Personality: Happy go lucky, loving and sweetObservations with Dogs: GoodObservations with Cats: Not yet testedObservations with Kids: GoodCurrently Living at: Foster-Charlie needs a forever home!What can we say about Charlie.....the most loving, sweet, even tempered dog we have met to date. Sweet Charlie was found by our rescuers in the county shelter, scared and miserable. As soon as the door to his cage was opened, we noticed Charlie had difficulty standing and had to help him up. He followed us out of the shelter to our car, limping all the way. Once in the car, Charlie transformed into the sweet and happy boy we know, giving everyone around him kisses.We immediately took Charlie to the vet, and x-rays revealed that his leg had been broken, and healed incorrectly. Charlie had to have been in tremendous pain, yet his demeanor remained sweet and happy. Charlie had surgery to re-break the leg and set it with metal plates, and made a full recovery. He runs and plays like every other dog.Charlie tested heartworm positive. Our doggie trooper has handled life's misfortunes better than most people would. He has received the treatment and is completely recovered.  Please consider donating to help us fund his medical expenses. http://www.youcaring.com/dc-paws-rescue-401354#.VbacK6XpcOI.facebookWe love Charlie, and we know you will too!UPDATE-Charlie had his surgery on 7/16, and we were in complete shock when the vet informed us that his injury was from a gun shot! How anyone could have done this to our sweet Charlie is unfathomable, but Charlie is out of the hospital and on the road to recovery.Like most shelter dogs, Charlie may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS’ fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog.If you are interested in adopting Charlie, please submit an adoption application at http://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/.If you are interested in adopting, please submit an adoption application at http://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/.

Please contact Jenny Cope (giveadogahome@live.com) for more information about this pet.All pets adopted out will be spay/neutered, micro-chipped, de-wormed,heartworm tested, rabies and relevant vaccinations.  NO DOG WILL BE ADOPTED TO BE AN OUTSIDE DOG!   Monthly Heartworm preventative, and monthly flea/tick preventative must be administered throughout the course of the dogs life.  The adoption donation of dogs may vary. Please check out each individual dogs information for the minimum donation amount.  The Application can be downloaded from the website, or feel free to email to request one.   www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org  Indepth application, references and a home check will be required before adoption is completed. Anyone wanting to adopt a German Shepherd MUST have knowledge about their needs. These are very intelligent dogs that need lots of exercise, both physically and mentally. Please discuss and consider if you are now, and will be in the foreseable future, in a financial position to provide to the dogs needs, unexpected vet bills, and common health issues specific to the breed.SAMSON is neutered, rabies, core vaccines, de-wormed, heart-worm Negative and micro-chipped. He has an estimated date of birth of 19 December 2011and weighs around 71 pounds. SAMSON was adopted from GaDaH back in February 2013 with his friend THUNDER. Both boys were around 12-15 months old. Recently I received a phone call from a kill shelter in Texas saying that both SAMSON and THUNDER had been surrendered due to the family no longer being able to afford them. This is a breach of contract since GaDaH ALWAYS takes our dogs back into rescue. Thankfully the shelter had contacted me and with our amazing volunteers in Texas we was able to pick them up that same day and get them to the safety of one of our temporary foster homes whilst waiting for transport up to the rescue in Sebec, Maine. SAMSON has been at the rescue in Sebec, Maine since 15th March and although he and THUNDER are somewhat bonded, SAMSON is a lot more confident and happier venturing out with the other dogs. He is getting quite vocal and I am sure that it will be a matter of time before he is going to become one of the alpha dogs in the rescue. He does stay close to me and checks where I am, when we are all settled down for the evening, he is always lay by my side. Although I would like to keep both boys together, I do feel that SAMSON would benefit from a family that wants a confident dog and understands that he has been through a lot and it appears he is letting everyone know that he is here and not going to be intimidated. I think he will calm down, he is not aggressive, but just vocal and strutting around. He will most definitely need an alpha family and one that understands the German Shepherd mentality, their need to protect and their need for a family with alpha personality. Although SAMSON is confident and has this macho attitude, I do think he is a little insecure and he needs a family that will allow him to get close and let him gain the trust and learn that he now has his true forever family who would never dump him in a shelter. SAMSON doesn't appear to have had any training although he is responsive. Whilst being with his family the past 3 years there are no records of any rabies booster, heartworm tests or booster vaccines. We have got him up to date and thank fully he has tested heartworm negative. Although SAMSON weighs around 71 pounds he does need to gain some weight. He rides great in a car and seems to enjoy himself, but I think SAMSON is the dog that will enjoy lots of training and challenging activities. SAMSON would benefit from an active family who understands the GSD and working dog breed and their needs. He will need basic and advanced obedience and this is always best done with his new family so all can learn each others personalities, body language, expectations and boundaries for all can be set. SAMSON needs a family that has a lot of time to give and spend with him and let him adapt and adjust to starting a life with a family again. SAMSON is available for adoption through Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue for an adoption fee of $450. If you are interested in adopting this handsome soul and giving him the life he needs and deserves our application can be completed and submitted on our website under the APPLICATION tab. http://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/application.html For more photos of SAMSON, please follow the link below http://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/samson.html SAMSON is located at the rescue in Sebec, Maine. We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. There is a local hotel in Dover-Foxcroft that is pet-friendly (approx 6 miles) and several in Bangor (approx 45 miles). We can occasionally arrange transport for dogs from the rescue to Middletown, CT for a fee, to cover volunteer fuel/expenses for $150.

Recently I received a phone call from a ill shelter in Texas saying that both THUNDER and SAMSON had been surrendered due to the family no longer being able to afford them.

Thankfully the shelter had contacted me and with our amazing volunteers in Texas we was able to pick them up that same day and get them to the safety of one of our temporary foster homes whilst waiting for transport up to the rescue in Sebec, Maine. The shelter did tell me that THUNDER was aggressive, however, when our volunteers went to pick him up as soon as they was away from the shelter he calmed down. THUNDER is very wary and a little nervous, he is clearly upset and confused with what has happened, living with a family to then being dumped in a kill shelter not knowing why or what was happening to him. THUNDER has been at the rescue in Sebec, Maine sine 15th March and although he and SAMSON are somewhat bonded, THUNDER definitely feels more secure being wherever I am. He has tried to guard me from the other dogs, which I do not allow, but I understand he is doing it more for his own security. Although I would like to keep both boys together, I do feel that THUNDER would benefit from a family that wants a dog to spend almost all their time with them. A family that understands the German Shepherd mentality, their need to protect and their need for a family with alpha personality. THUNDER is more sensitive and would benefit from training and lots of one on one to build up his confidence. I do feel when he has his confidence and has settled and knows he truly is with his perfect forever family he will relax a lot and start to enjoy life as he should. THUNDER doesn't appear to have had any training although he is responsive. Whilst being with his family the past 3 years there are no records of any rabies booster, heartworm tests or booster vaccines. We have got him up to date and thank fully he has tested heartworm negative. Although THUNDER weighs around 75 pounds he does need to gain some weight. He rides great in a car and seems to enjoy himself, but I think THUNDER is the dog that will enjoy himself anywhere he is with his humans. THUNDER is doing great with all the other dogs, but as mentioned he doesn't like it when they come near me. We are working on this and I do believe it is just from his insecurity of all that has happened to him this past month. THUNDER loves to go for car rides but does pull a lot on the leash. She will need a family that is prepared to work with her on basic and advanced obedience training. It is better if the family does the training as they will be able to learn her body language, characteristics and personality easier and JADE will learn their personality, body language, guidelines and expectations a lot quicker too. THUNDER would benefit from an active family who understands the GSD and working dog breed and their needs. In time he will need basic and advanced obedience and this is always best done with his new family so all can learn each others personalities, body language, expectations and boundaries for all can be set. THUNDER really needs a family that has a lot of time to give and spend with him. THUNDER is available for adoption through Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue for an adoption fee of $450. If you are interested in adopting this handsome soul and giving him the life he needs and deserves our application can be completed and submitted on our website under the APPLICATION tab. http://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/application.html For more photos of THUNDER, please follow the link below http://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/thunder.html THUNDER is located at the rescue in Sebec, Maine. We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. There is a local hotel in Dover-Foxcroft that is pet-friendly (approx 6 miles) and several in Bangor (approx 45 miles). We can occasionally arrange transport for dogs from the rescue to Middletown, CT for a fee, to cover volunteer fuel/expenses for $150. This will be dependent upon our volunteers availability so is not guaranteed.Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue San Antonio / Devine, TEXAS giveadogahome@live.com PAYPAL - giveadogahome@live.com                
03/19/2016	Jemma - American Bulldog / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Bulldog-Unknown Mix	Fairfax, VA	Female	Posted Breed: American Bulldog / Mixed (short coat). Jemma is an American Bulldog mix at best guess. She's totally sweet and a big love bug. She's about 7 yrs old and a little portly, but not overweight. She has the bulldog face and body, natural ears and a long tail, which she likes to was a LOT! Jemma is great with other dogs and all people and kids. She appears to have a little too much interest in cats so probably shouldn't live with them. She enjoys her food, but also enjoys taking walks to stay fit and meet new folks. She'd be a great family dog and would love all the attention. She's a perfect sweetie!**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA** We have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.

03/19/2016	Midnight - Black Labrador Retriever / Akita (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Cabool, MO	Female	"Posted Breed: Black Labrador Retriever / Akita (short coat). Please contact Susan (ozarksummer@yahoo.com) for more information about this pet.Midnight would LOVE to be a couch potatoe! She loves to flop on the couch and lounge about! As her chin greys, her young spirit thrives!!!!! She needs a home of her own where she could be the Queen! Midnight is not recommended for housemates, she is a people person but does not do well with other animals. ******************************************** If any single word describes our girl Midnight, its HAPPY!!! She greets everyone she meets with a happy face and wagging tail, a tail wagging so hard her whole back end is wiggling. Midnight walks very nicely on leash, likes to explore and LOVES her walks. She does pull a bit sometimes but a tug and the command to ""come"" and she is right back with you. She listens really well, knows her name and comes when called. She knows the command for sit and will sit for you to put the leash on when ready to go for a walk. Though has trouble keeping her behind still with all the tail wagging going on:) Midnight enjoys riding in a vehicle, lays down and rides along very calmly and nicely. Midnight is nicely mannered in the house, figured out the doggy door right away. Though would need some training in a new setting. She loves her toys and rawhide bones and is content to lay and chew and relax. Very much a cuddle bug, loves to lay her head in your lap and adores petting and cuddling. Very much wants to be with you and be a part of things. And am sure she would enjoy being a couch potato part of the time. Midnight meets other dogs calmly, though won't back down if challenged. Must have a secure fenced yard for her safety.  Previous post Beautiful Midnight has been with us a while, and we just can’t understand why no one wants to adopt her! She is sweet, devoted, loving, playful, and incredibly smart! She loves to play with her stuffed “babies”(though they all eventually end up gutted!), and loves to bury any special goodies she’s given- bones, rawhides, kongs- anything not immediately edible is buried for later relocation and reburial(don’t ask, we haven’t figured it out yet). She is talkative- NOT barkative- more like a Siamese cat- grumblings and moanings, and even laughings! She has a wicked chuckle! She ALSO has an extremely spooky and fantastically cool howl, but she only uses that when a siren goes by. She can rearrange her living quarters to better suit herself, and DOES. She does NOT take your hand as well when you give her a treat. She considers herself a Lap Dog, and is completely shameless in pursuing that goal! Midnight is also very high-energy, so maybe having her for a jogging partner would be a good idea! She DOES love to cuddle, so she is really the ideal dog! Smart, loyal, loving, playful, happy, gentle(except with stuffed toys)- this girl deserves a fabulous forever home!!! Special considerations made for homes with other dogs, some play mates considered. Midnight is doggy door trained.                "

My name is Grayson and I am a wonderful 3 year old gentle Shepherd and Labrador Mix I am 60 lbs, big and beautiful and I was found wandering the streets and my owners never came for me so when it was time to be killed, someone contacted Gingers Pet Rescue and they saved my life.  I am happy to be in Seattle and I wish for a really nice home and family where I can stay with forever and safe, warm and loved. I will be your best friend. I love walks, and I like to explore. we can go hiking, swimming and sight seeing too. I just got saved out of a nerve-wracking stint on Death Row at a local high kill shelter in California. My personality is blossoming and I am so lucky to embark on a new and exciting adventure finding my very own wonderful forever home in Seattle thanks to Ginger's Pet Rescue. My adoption fee of $ 395.00 covers Spay/Neuter, DA2PP shots, Rabies, Bordatella, Deworm, Advantage Flea Treated, Heart worm Test, Grooming, Microchip, Boarding Fees, Health Certificate and transport cost from California to Seattle. This adoption fee will also go towards helping many of our rescued dogs who are in desperate need of orthopedic surgery, dental and teeth extractions, hernias, cherry eye removals and boarding fees. Donations are always appreciated to help us pay down our huge vet bills which now runs over $ 13,000. This adoption fee is firm as the pet rescue needs to recoup the money they spent in order to save the next dog in need. We have a huge vet bill and donations are appreciated as well We are a non profit 501 C 3 Organization Please email for an application so we can meet soon                
03/19/2016	Tammy - Doberman Pinscher / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Doberman Pinscher-Unknown Mix	Asheville, NC	Female	Posted Breed: Doberman Pinscher / Mixed (short coat). Please contact Elise (elise@bwar.org) for more information about this pet. Tammy is a gorgeous, playful, well-mannered and extra-large mush looking for a forever home. Tammy's DNA profile shows her to be a Doberman Pinscher/Australian Shepherd mix. For sure she is an independent free spirit, born around December 2009. Tammy’s favorite pastimes include going for walks and hikes in quiet areas, going for car rides, getting massages, playing tug, and snuggling, snuggling and more snuggling. Tammy is house-trained and likes to chew and play with toys and bones. She's the type of dog who will be extremely loyal, affectionate and protective of her family. She does not really like sharing her things with other dogs and would prefer to be the only pet in her home. Tammy is looking for a loving yet structured adult home with a yard with a secure physical fence. Experience with and appreciation of guarding breeds is a plus. If you are looking for a friend for life and a huge snuggle bug to chill at home on the couch with, look no further. Bonus points if you have a home in the woods with a front porch where Tammy can lounge and watch the world go by.

He's a delightful and sweet dog with a terrific temperament. Gentle and low key, but he can play with the best of them.  Chevy's owner heartlessly dumped him into a very high local kill shelter.

Chevy is in the prime of his life, and he's such a nice dog. Chevy is grateful for every bit of attention he gets here, and he's very undemanding. He deserves a loving home where he will be cherished for the rest of his days. He's one of our special ones here.  Would you like to meet Chevy?

About HHADR:  Our rescue dogs are saved from high kill shelters in MS, TN and AR. We also rescue from the surrounding Milwaukee, WI area. Most dogs are completely vetted in the south and then travel to our 2nd rescue in WI, although we also have 3 vet clinics in the Mukwonago area that we use. Our WI location is at 776 Swan Drive in Mukwonago. We do a monthly adoption event AND we show dogs BY APPOINTMENT ONLY the rest of the month. You MUST complete the adoption application and be approved before we will set up a meet and greet! Our ""main"" and/or founding location is in Crenshaw, MS, approximately an hour south of Memphis, TN. Our county has NO animal control, therefore we get a LOT of dogs and puppies dumped on our property and many, many of them are abandoned, abused, emaciated...just plain neglected their whole lives.... so of course we do anything and everything possible to get them ""adoptable"", but along with that comes 1000's and 1000's of dollars in vet bills. Our adoption fee is our main source of income, so please do not ask for a ""discount"".

03/19/2016	Gina E - Labrador Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	San Diego, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed. Gina E is going to tell you her story in her own barks! Sniff Sniff, Woof, Woof...thanks for checking me out. I think I am pretty cute and I hope you do to. My story began when my family left me at a shelter in LA and they never came back for me. It was so lonely and I was scared until these nice rescue people picked me up and gave me a chance. Well my first family left me in the backyard by myself in a concrete pen so I never learned any manners and I had a ton of energy. So lots of people who met me liked me but they didn't like my bad manners. But one family took me home and I had fun. I loved getting into their baby toys, jumping on the kids and making the house mine...but I guess they didn't like it too much. They took me back to the rescue. So then I went to this place in the country and I spent time with this great lady who taught me things and I learned and I liked learning. Now I know lots of stuff and at my foster home they think I am the bomb!!! I like my crate and can spend time in there and I don't bark. I sleep on the chair by my foster mom's bed and I sleep all night. I know how to sit, stay, come, place, and heel. I go in my crate when asked and I eat my food nicely. My favorite thing in the world is attention from my people and I have learned to be gentle and not to pester too much. My favorite home would be with a family where the kids are older and understand I am a big ole goof, they can even take me on walks then. Other dogs are okay but I'd rather have you to myself and I'm really good as an only dog. Going on walks is fun and I'm pretty darn good. I love people, love playing, and love chewing on bones. My family will be so happy when they bring me home because I am ready to go. The adoption includes the altering of the dog, current vaccinations, and microchipping. For more information on the Adoption Donation and our Adoption Process please visit our website at www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt. You will find our online adoption application there as well. Once you are approved to adopt we will discuss how to meet our available dogs. Our dogs are NOT housed at our mailing address. We are a 501(c)3 Non-Profit, all volunteer organization. Thank you for reaching out to rescue a dog in need of hope!                
03/19/2016	Rocket - Labrador Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Fairport, NY	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed. Rocket is a 5.5 year old Lab/mix, weighs a hefty 82.5 pounds, and loves to play fetch. If you don&#39;t mind the slobber, he will keep you tossing a ball all day long. His leash walking needs a bit more practice as he is in a big hurry, always. Rocket came to Lollypop Farm because his owners felt he needed more attention. I challenge you to find any color in his coat, other than black, on this dog. He does have warm, brown eyes that could melt the coldest heart. He loved the soft treats, but the crunchy biscuits, not so much. He would do best in a home without very young children, basically due to his size. Come meet this good dog, he wants to be sure your family is complete. That means him in it!

He is a very athletic dog with a lot of energy! Kirby has a condition known as demodex, which has nearly resolved. His new owner will have follow-up veterinary care, including daily medication, to continue after adoption. Kirby is great with other dogs, however he can sometimes play too rough due to his energy level. He is hoping to join an recreational team so he can continue running!

03/19/2016	Holly (TN) - White German Shepherd Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Sherman, IL	Female	Posted Breed: White German Shepherd. Please contact Echo Dogs (adoptions@echodogs.org) for more information about this pet.My name is Holly and I am a 3.5 year old, 95 lb. spayed female. I am both housebroken and crate-trained, although I don’t really need to be crated. I am still working on mastering my leash skills, but I am making great progress!! I am comfortable with both men and women and welcome visitors to my home. I do like children of all ages inside the house, but I do have a tendency to herd children when they are playing outside so I will need an adult-only home. I have a strong prey drive so I cannot go to a home with cats or any other small animals. I am not dog-aggressive, but I would really prefer to be an only dog so I can be the center of attention! I love being with my people, one might even call me a Velcro dog, so I would not be happy left home alone all day. My  ideal home would be with a family who has someone around most of the time. I love my toys and will happily play fetch with you. I like to ride in cars and will be glad to tag along and run your errands with you. I am happy just to be anywhere as long as it is with you!! Are you the right family for me?     For more information, please contact Adoptions.   Echo Dogs fosters dogs in many states. Visit Echo Dogs White Shepherd Rescue to see more of our dogs. Transportation for the adopted dog IS available. Remember, we are an all-volunteer foster rescue organization - we DO NOT have a physical shelter to visit. Our minimum adoption donation is $300. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations and micro-chipped. Puppies under 6 months old may not be spayed/neutered.

03/19/2016	Sig - German Shepherd Dog (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Harriman, TN	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (long coat). East TN Pit Bull Rescue is a Tennessee Non-profit corporation with 501(c)3 status.Sig is a 3 year old 95 pound beauty.  He is very playful and loving to his family.  Sig loves playing fetch, playing in water and going for walks in the neighborhood.  He absolutely loves water and will not think twice about getting into a shower with you when you are not paying attention. We keep a kiddy pool in our back yard and he loves it during the hot summer months. He also enjoys his daily brushings which we do to help with his shedding.  Sig makes my family feel so safe. When he is inside he only barks when he is trying to let me know something.  I know when deliveries are being dropped off on my porch with out the need of a door bell. Sig will become your shadow. He loves being with his family and wants to please.  Sig can be trusted to be left alone in the house with out the worry of tearing anything up.  He loves toys from stuff animals to chew bones.  When you ask him to go get his baby he will go straight to his stuff animal and show you.  He is extremely smart!    Sig’s biggest down fall is he must be introduced to new people slowly & properly. He is very protective of his loved ones and you can not rush new people on him. This maybe something he grows out of over time with training too but for now you must take it very slowly. Once he accepts you then you are in for life.  Sig is not a dog you would take to a dog park. That would be too much commotion for him and he would get very stressed out.    Sig would do great with an active family who goes on daily walks with him. He needs to have his daily play time and exercise.    He has been neutered, current on all shots, receives heart guard & flea protection monthly and AKC registered.   For more information on Sig, please contact Carol at CTaylor2@strategicequipment.com or fill out the online application at www.etnpitbullrescue.org.East TN Pit Bull Rescue adopts out to companion homes only.

This scared little guy is Cornbread. He is a Black & Tan Hound, approximately 2 years old. Cornbread was surrendered to HCAS because he will not hunt. He is undersocialized but still sweet as can be - he''s just nervous. We''ve seen a lot of hound dogs like Cornbread and they often make the best indoor companions a family can ask for. With a little time and patience (and A LOT OF LOVE), Cornbread could be the perfect pup to curl up on the couch with. He doesn''t show any signs of aggression and would probably do great with kids.

03/19/2016	Georgie - Husky / Hound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	vacaville, CA	Male	"Posted Breed: Husky / Hound / Mixed (short coat). Georgie is a very handsome, 5-year-old, husky-hound mix. While he might look intimidating, he has a child-like curiosity and is actually easily startled by sudden movements and sounds. He has come a long way in foster care and he enjoys walks, daytime naps, and training sessions with treats! He is very calm in the house - even by himself. He has yet to make any noises, but he does show interest in meeting other dogs his size. He adores the household cat, and he absolutely loves to sniff EVERYTHING. He appears to be house-trained, he knows ""sit"" perfectly well, and he is a wonderful jogging partner. He is sensitive to being touched and hugged at first, but once he warms up to you, he'll be by your side all the time (and taking up way more room on the bed than you thought). Georgie longs to find a forever family, so if you're looking for a low maintenance, gorgeous, highly loyal best friend - come meet Georgie at his foster home in Davis, CA!                "

Meet Augie doggie! *courtesy post-contact Kimberly at 310-770-5465 for adoption info!  Augie was rescued from the South Los Angeles animal shelter, and is believed to be a Labrador/ Pit bull mix. He was a stray before someone turned him into the shelter. Augie is approximately 2yrs old, neutered, micro chipped and up to date on shots. He loves to play with rope toys, balls, and squeaky toys ( but he usually chews the squeaker out of the toy fairly quickly!) Augie is great with people and kids...he even licks the postman! Augie is not good with cats. He can be leash aggressive with dogs he doesn't know and needs a strong handler. He can get along with other dogs if properly introduced. Augie is very sweet, sleeps in his crate, and has basic obedience training (sit, lie down, loose leash walking.) He needs to work on not jumping when he is excited. With a little training and a lot of love he could be a great companion!  Please contact Kimberly Morgan-Greene at 310-770-5465 or via email at kimberlylyngreene@yahoo.com to meet Augie and for more information

03/19/2016	Tanner - German Shepherd Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Palo Alto, CA	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (medium coat). We will be at the Palo Alto Pet Food Express Saturday, March 19th and Sunday, March 20th from 12-3pm. * If you are interested in a dog, please first read the biography on the dog (keep scrolling down for the bio!) and then go to our website, www.dpsrescue.com for an application. * We do not have a facility. All dogs live in foster homes. Arrangements to meet dogs occur after an approved application has been accepted. * We do not ship our dogs for any reason. * Our adoption fee is $400 for each dog/puppy. * If it is on a weekend of our adoptions, follow us on @DPSRescue on Twitter to get real time updates on our adoptions. We will also post at the end of the evening the names of those dogs who have been adopted: www.facebook.com/DPSRescueThis dog will be at Palo Alto Pet Food Express on Saturday, March 19th and Sunday, March 20th from 12-3pm or until adopted. If you would like the first opportunity to adopt, please fill out an application to be considered. Tanner is a 3 year old German Shepherd Dog. He weighs about 65lbs now and is about 10-15lbs under weight. At his optimum weight he will be a big boy! He is strong and enthusiastic. He responds exceedingly well to males. He clearly defers to them and almost immediately respects most males he meets. He is a little more willing to test the boundaries with females. He will need not only a physically strong owner but also one who is experienced (beyond growing up with dogs or pet sitting someone's dog) but rather the experience and leadership that comes from owning a lifetime of dogs, especially herding dogs. He responds very well to those who take a leadership role as opposed to a more positive reinforcement driven role. Tanner gets along well with other dogs. He currently lives with big and small dogs. He plays well and seems to have a positive interaction with all we have had him with. He was previously in a kennel type of situation with another rescue and they said he did not do well in that setting. He definitely needs to get his energy out by running, biking, hiking or some type of outdoor activity beyond walking. Even 10 walks a day would not meet his energy! Tanner likes his kennel in his foster home. He loves to go in the car for rides. We will only consider homes that have had a dog in the last 3 years. We will consider homes with kids who are over the age of 12 unless they have most recently had a herding or working dog and the kids were an integral part of the training and leadership in the home.

We want to make sure if you are interested in a dog that we have the dog at adoptions but that can only happen if you fill out an application ahead of time and are pre-approved. (Generally this must happen prior to the weekend) **If you are wanting to submit an application within 24 hours of an event, please print off the application and bring with you as well as submitting it. You may still submit it and if time and volunteers permit, we will contact you. Most applications submitted the weekend of adoptions are not responded to until after the adoption weekend.

03/19/2016	Mikey - Rhodesian Ridgeback / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rhodesian Ridgeback-Unknown Mix	Hillsdale, IN	Male	Posted Breed: Rhodesian Ridgeback / Mixed (short coat). Mikey was surrendered by his owners when they could no longer care for him. His eyes were so swollen and goopy he could barely see out of them. His owners said he had allergies. It may have started off as allergies, but his poor eyes were so inflamed his eyelids had rolled inward and his eyelashes were scratching his corneas. The shelter tried raising money to fix his eyes but ended up covering most of the cost of surgery since he could not wait any longer or he would end up blind. We hope to continue to raise funds to pay off his vet bill!Mikey is now feeling MUCH better and you can tell by the smile on his face! He will need to stay on allergy medicine (benadryl works just fine for him) to prevent his eyes from becoming inflamed again. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines and LOVES kids and other dogs. He is 4 years old and weighs 63 lbs. You really could not find a better dog than Mikey. Now that his eyes are on the mend he is ready to find his loving forever family that will give him the life he deserves--pain and itch free!!! Come meet this sweet boy today and see why shelter staff could not give up on making his life more comfortable. Unless otherwise stated, the adoption fee for dogs over 4 months is $120.00. Puppies under 4 months are $140.00 The adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, microchip, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy is that all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter. Our shelter is open to the public on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 1:00 pm until 5:00 pm and other times by appointment.

Please contact Adoption (coastalgsrsd@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Fado has spent the first four and a half years of his life with a wonderful man who was his life. He was his companion, his friend, his sidekick. Everyday they ran their 3 miles. They went to the park to work on Fado’s training. At home, Fado spent his days with his family where he watched out for them as he joined in the family’s activities. He had a full life. And then life changed for everyone. After trying everything he could, Fado’s friend realized that in the end, Fado was suffering. He was alone and didn’t like it. He didn’t have the daily runs or the trips with his companion. He made the selfless choice to entrust Fado to Coastal to help give him the life he had once had, the life he loves so much. We promised to do that. We are looking for a home for Fado that has German Shepherd experience and lots of time, time to give Fado the life he deserves, one of trips to the park where he can run and chase his toy, someone how can jog would be nice, but if you can walk, that’s okay too, so long as he gets his regular exercise. He also appreciates the need to keep up his training and can learn a few commands in German. We all know how rusty we can get without practice. Fado wants another family who will make him a part of the pack. He loves to be part of the pack but needs to have a pack leader. Please visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/to learn more about our dogs.

He loves to be the center of attention and spread his affection to whoever is around. He’s still young and needs some training, but he’s smart. He gets along with other dogs, kids, and grown-ups. He DOES have one little quirk – he likes to eat coins! He threw up 6 quarters on the day he came into Rescue! So his new family will need to keep an eye on this little “piggy bank.”   Hunter is “hunting” for a great new home. Is it yours? Please visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/to learn more about our dogs.

Please contact Adoption (coastalgsrsd@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Lucky is a beautiful gray shepherd with a panda-like face. After being neglected by his former family, this lovely boy is truly looking for his luck to change. Lucky is a mellow, easy-going dog. He is incredibly well-behaved and loves other dogs, both big and small. He is not confrontational, but exudes an underlying strength and confidence. He loves to go for rides in the car and walks very nicely on a leash. In fact, he trots like a stallion! He isn’t housebroken, but we’re working on it. It appears he may have been an “outside only” dog in his last home. Although we have no idea whether he could live with cats, we do know that he will chase anything small that moves (eg, rabbits, birds) – so cats are probably out.   Lucky needs another dog in his life; he would be bored and sad if he were all alone. Someone will be lucky to bring Lucky into their life. Care to try YOUR luck?

This is Ginger an Aussie mix who was picked up by animal control with 6 pups about 8 weeks old. All her pups have been adopted and now it is her turn. They were all so mangy and full of ticks that they had very little fur. After months of treatments and meds, her fur has come in full and glossy.  She is very easy going with people but can be pushy and herding with other dogs so she would do best in an only dog setting. She loves her evening walks along the culverts that are full of water and frogs right now. She is fascinated with trying to catch the frogs.  She does enjoy rides in the car and walks well on a leash so would make a great hiking and walking pal . If you have room in your heart and home, please fill out an application on our website or contact tlandry002@comcast.net.   ~~All of our dogs are spayed/ neutered before adoption. Adult dogs have had their core vaccines; parvo, distemper, bordatella, rabies, and puppies have had a series of four vaccines. All dogs are tested and are heartworm negative.

Adoption fees range from 175.00-235.00 depending on the dog. Many times the adoption fee does not even cover the cost of all of the vetting we have done for a dog.

03/19/2016	Kayla - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Austin, TX	Female	"Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. When first meeting Kayla, it is not uncommon that she will immediately climb into your lap and give you a gentle lick on the nose. ""We are friends now, yes?"" she seems to say.We just thought we should warn you that if you meet Kayla, chances are, you're coming home with Kayla.Kayla is just a sweetheart. She's playful and loving in equal measure. She is happy to meet new friends, and to show them her ball, and then plop down next to them for pets. If you are not in the mood for pets, then she is also happy to chew on her toys next to you until you are. She loves giving kisses, but they are so gentle and polite they are almost European. ""Hello, dahling! So good to see you!""We think Kayla would do well in most homes. She'd probably prefer a more bustling one, with lots of people to keep her company. Her energy level is around a medium-high. She's not hyper, but really enjoys being active. She would likely be a great running partner when she gets older. She will still need to work on house and leash training, but she does know sit which is a good start! She has met older children, but hasn't been introduced to very young kids or cats yet. We received some notes that she occasionally resource guards, but that behavior isn't often observed at APA! She's been getting along well with other dogs, even with treats around. We would be happy to arrange a meeting with anyone you have at home, human or otherwise.Kayla's a solid, all-around good dog. She'd be a welcome addition in any family. Come on down and meet her!                "

I have the cutest markings on my body; I have four white paws that make me look like I am wearing socks, and a cute little white tip on my tail. My leash manners are okay; I do pull when I am excited, but will probably calm down once I am in a home. I appear to be house trained, and get along with the other dogs in the shelter; it is unknown how I react to cats. It would be best that I go to a home with older, respectful children because I may knock smaller children down when I get excited.

Dogs need several things to be happy, such as being kept inside where they can be part of the family, regular vet care, toys, nutritious food, clean water, obedience class, socialization with people and pets, and most importantly, lots of love and attention! They need regular grooming and baths and heartworm prevention medicine every month for their entire lives. Depending on the breed, dogs can live to 20 years of age.

03/19/2016	Mary ~ Soul Sister! - Boxer / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer-Unknown Mix	Caldwell, NJ	Female	Posted Breed: Boxer / Mixed (short coat). Mary’s Woof-Facts  Looking for a foster and forever home Crate-trained, housebroken, spayed, and up-to-date on vaccines Playful, dog friendly girl Loves people, a loyal companion Home with older children preferred Fairly active – requires at least one long daily walk, plus play time    “Love is our deepest longing. Just as the body needs food the soul needs love.”   There’s Something About Mary Hello, I’m Mary, a seven-years-young boxer mix who is looking for my love, my caretaker, my loyal companion. Have you ever heard the expression, “Tall, Dark & Handsome” – well, I’m “Tall, Bright & Beautiful.”. I’m a bit statuesque and weigh 55 pounds (more of me to love!). I have a gorgeous shiny coat and radiate beauty, both inside and out.   I enjoy meeting people — I like when they pet me and, of course, when they give me treats (feeds my body and my soul!). Sometimes, it may take a little while for me to warm up to new people, but in heartbeat, I’m giving them my snuggles. I like kids too, but because I’m somewhat of a big girl, I’d be best in a home with older children. Taking walks around my neighborhood and exploring new smells is heavenly. There are times when I can get a bit nervous when other dogs approach and bark at me (I prefer tranquility), but I’m working on letting that stuff go (who needs to get caught up in other dogs’ chaos, right – woof woof!) I am crate trained but of course I prefer to be out of my crate and laying on the couch!. I’m a smart girl and a quick learner — I already know some commands, like sit, dropping the ball on command, and wait.    Mary’s Background Somehow I had found myself in an inner city shelter, and I was terribly sad. It also broke the hearts of the volunteers there. I was incredibly blessed when FernDog came to my rescue. Overcome with joy that day, my tail started wagging, and it hasn’t stopped since.   Here’s What My Foster Parents Say About Me I’m told that I have the most beautiful face and a deep soulful gaze. I take naps in this built-in nook that my foster family has in their kitchen – it feels so good to soak up the warm rays of the sunlight and reflect on how lucky I am in this new life I am living. Playing fetch is one of my favorite activities so doing that in my forever home would be fun and would help keep my physique looking fantastic! I enjoy other dogs after having some time to get to know them. I am playful and can jump in my playfulness (it’s fun and freeing, admit it!), so it would be best if I’m either the only dog in the home or if the other dog in the family also delights in a very active play style – we could have a blast together! I walk fairly well on my leash and enjoy long strolls with my foster family — I only pull when another dog barks at me. We are working on keeping my energy in check when I see other dogs on walks, as well as learning how to read other dogs’ body language when at play. I’m a perfectly polite lady in the house, as I do not chew on anything except my toys, which I truly relish. Last but certainly not least, I treasure resting my head right in your lap for some serious cuddle time.   Mary’s Forever Home I’m a joyful girl, and I’d be absolutely tickled pink to find my forever home. Are you ready to look into my soulful eyes and tell me it’s all going to be OK and we are going to spend a lifetime of genuine love and caring together? If so, please contact FernDog, and let them know that there’s something about Mary that you simply can’t resist.

His foster mom gives George nothing but glowing reviews! He's a great listener that is eager to please and has come a long way in his training. This smart boy knows sit and will do so for treats and when leashing up to go outside. He loves taking walks with his foster family and never strays too far from his foster mom. George always comes when called and is perfectly house trained. George is very treat motivated and this will take him a long way with any further training. He loves playing with his toys (especially balls) and happily entertains himself while his mom works from home. He loves taking car rides and makes the most perfect co-pilot. He'll even keep your seat warm! This easy going guy enjoys sleeping at his foster moms feet while she watches TV and is just happy to be around his people. He's a happy go-lucky dog that would do great with bigger kids (only due to size). He's an incredible companion who is as loyal as they come!

03/19/2016	MAMACITA - Pit Bull Terrier (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Springfield, MA	Female	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier (medium coat). Meet Mama! This adorable lady is a 6 year old white and tan Pit Bull Terrier mix. She could likely get along with other pets in the home, but bring yours in to meet her before adopting. Staff are recommending that her new forever home have children 12 years or older in it. Mama is house broken and knows a couple commands, but training classes are still highly recommended to help Mama learn basic manners and keeping all her paws on the ground. Plus training classes increase bonding and are fun! Mama''s ears were cut incredibly short, but our vets do not think this will affect her at all and it add to her charm. Mama''s happiness is contagious and she is always excited to meet people. She also is a cuddle bug, and loves head and belly scratches. Her new family should be active, and be able to take her for daily walks. If your looking for a beautiful and sweet new friend, then come by and meet Mama!

This is SHERMAN! He loves being everywhere his people are. This guy was thrown from a car in the desert and left for dead when he was saved. He is a huge snuggler who just wants to be with his family. Sherman is neutered, up to date on all shots and micro chipped. He is also housebroken and crate trained! He As an only dog, Sherman has thrived. He loves to snuggle with the adults in our house, he tolerates life with a toddler, and he loves cleaning up after a baby who loves feeding his dog. Sherman needs a loving family to appreciate him and help him with his fear of new things. On a leash he pulls unless he uses a gentle leader, but he may stop to try and take it off. He responds to “leave it” and “easy” when he is walking to have him ignore something scary/interesting or to slow down. He LOVES to run next to you. Sherman loves new people, but he may jump or tinkle when initially meeting them. He wants to be hugged and scratched and after 5 minutes or so he will lie down and ignore them. He doesn’t play fetch, but he loves bully sticks, bones, squeaky toys, and playing with the towel or blankie monster (that’s when you can move your hand or an object under a blanket or a towel and he tries to get it. think like a fox in the snow.) He prefers to be alone and chew in piece or he likes you to move things around and he will stomp on it. Please give Sherman a chance to prove he's a great boy, although he does want to be the only dog in the house so he can get all the attention!​ *courtesy post-contact Meaghann at 619-871-6239 or by email meaghanndenyer@gmail.com

03/19/2016	Sirius - German Shepherd Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Baton Rouge, LA	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (medium coat). Meet Sirius (As in Sirius Black)!! Sirius is such a sweet boy and I can't believe he has had so much trouble finding a foster and forever home. He can stay in a kennel during the day and does very well in there. He also loves hanging out with you outside and sunbathing. He gets along with other dogs and clings to you like velcro. This boy is a big adorable lap dog. He has so so much love to give and he is so super sweet. He will find the perfect home one day and make someone a fantastic dog. He has hip dysplasia but doesn't let it stop him and doesn't indicate that it's hurting him. He looks big, but he's only about 60 lbs and he's so gentle. He's about 4 years old, grown out of his puppy energy, but still young enough to live a long life with his future family. He loves to sit in front of you and look up at you with his head on you and give you kisses on the cheek and lay in your lap or right next to you. He doesn't like when the other dogs go up to his kennel, but once he's out of his kennel he is great with them. He actually prefers to be in his kennel during the day and isn't destructive in the kennel, so his foster keeps his kennel in a bedroom and he is very comfortable there. He is housetrained and well behaved. His adoption fee includes neuter, up to date shots, and a microchip. Please consider opening your heart and home to this sweet boy!!  If you would like more information on this dog please contact APAWS at info@apawspets.org. If you would like to begin the adoption process and fill out an application please use our online application available here: http://www.apawspets.org/dog_application.html.

03/19/2016	Cutter - Hound / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Houston, TX	Male	Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed. Hi! My name is Cutter. Pleasure to meet you! Before I found my way to ADORE, I was a street dog like so many others. It’s scary out there when you don’t have a safe place to lay your head. With so many dogs roaming the streets of Houston, it was only a matter of time before I crossed paths with one that didn’t like me. I can’t imagine why, because I usually get along so well with other pups, but this one had a bone to pick with me. I was viciously attacked, but luckily a kind woman stumbled upon me and rushed me to the vet. With a little time and a lot of love, I healed up wonderfully and now I feel like a new dog!  When you live you’re whole life on the streets, moving into a fancy home can be a bit of an adjustment. I had never seen squeaky toys before, and I must say, they fascinated me from the first moment I heard their delightful squeaks! Now, I’m a total squeaky toy fanatic and I love to play fetch with them in the backyard. I live in a house with other dogs, and despite being attacked before I was rescued, I still love to play with my canine friends!  I’ve learned lots of new things since moving in with my foster family. For example, if you sit when humans ask you to, they will sometimes give you delicious treats! I also know how to stay and lay down. It was a little weird when I realized I couldn’t potty anywhere I wanted to like I did on the streets, but I’ve learned that the house is off-limits for such things. I also do great in my kennel, and I’m happy to spend some time lying in my bed nibbling on a bone. All this, and I’m a total cutie! Honestly, I can’t think of a single reason why you wouldn’t love me if you gave me a chance! If you adopt me, I promise that you won’t regret it!  I am up to date on vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped.  Adoption or Foster applications can be found at www.adorehouston.org!  If you have any questions please contact us at info@adorehouston.org  *NOTE* We are located in Houston, TX, but we do adopt to other states and Canada as well. Transport fees for the flight are determined by the dog’s weight and the cost of the traveling kennel, and the fee includes: spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip, and health certificate.

03/19/2016	Junior - German Shepherd Dog / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog-Unknown Mix	Benton, AR	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog / Mixed. PLEASE NOTE! Unless stated otherwise, our dogs and puppies are located in Arkansas, and transported to the north/northeast once adopted. We do occasionally have dogs/puppies placed in foster homes in the north/northeast. In the cases where the pet is somewhere other than Arkansas, it will be noted beside the name of the pet.3/15/2016 Meet Junior, aka J.R. Junior was rescued from a high kill shelter in Arkansas. He came into rescue absolutely terrified (as you can see in the last picture, taken the day of his rescue) but has done very well in his foster home. His foster mom works from home so she is available to take him outside to potty frequently and has had no accidents in the house. He is on a strict routine and his new family will need to understand that he needs a routine in order to feel secure. He may have accidents at first until he learns the new routine but should learn it quickly and be fine after that. Junior loves to hang out in his foster mom's home office, in his doggy bed. He also enjoys his crate, which is left open for him. At first, he took some coaxing to come out of his crate but has gotten better at that as he has learned to trust his foster mom. He also has recently begun to enjoy having visitors over and will show them affection when they are interested in him. Junior gets along very well with the other dogs in his foster home and his foster mom also has several cats which he is unconcerned with. He has not shown any aggression to anyone. Junior prefers to be within eyesight of his person as much as possible and gets extremely anxious if left outside without his foster mom. He much prefers leash walks rather than being loose in the fenced yard. He has just never had a loving family and now that he has someone showing him love, he doesn't want to lose it. He will need a transition period once adopted. He will need time to understand that his new family will be loving to him, just as his foster mom has been. But if you are willing to give him the time to adjust, he will repay you with a lifetime of unconditional love. He will be well worth the effort. Junior is about 1 1/2 years old and weighs about 40lbs. He is neutered, up to date on shots, and heartworm negative. Junior is located in a foster home in Arkansas but out of state transport is available. For more info, email kelley.aasr@gmail.comOur typical adoption fee for puppies younger than 6 months old is $300, and for older puppies and adults, the typical fee is $250. This includes spay/neuter, up to date vaccinations, dewormings, flea/tick treatment, and heartworm test (as well as treatment if they test positive) for all pups/dogs over 6 months old. There is a transport fee of $140 per dog. We use Got Orphans Transport, and you can see more about them at www.gotorphanstransport.com. For more info regarding adopting, email kelley.aasr@gmail.com.

03/19/2016	A347229  Ellie Mae - American Bulldog / American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Bulldog-American Staffordshire Terrier Mix	San Antonio, TX	Female	Posted Breed: American Bulldog / American Staffordshire Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Ellie Mae is just the sweetest dog I've ever met. All she wants is to be loved on, doesn't matter who, or where, just love! she likes to play but I would suggest only big dogs as playmates as she tends to get a little too rough. Ellie can be very active but also quite the couch potato. Ellie's underbite and adorable pig snort makes her impossible not to squeeze. Ellie is very alert. That is one of the wonderful things about her, if you have kids she WILL look for them. She will let you know if someone is there. shes not a door knock barker but when she does bark its for a reason. No false alarms with her. She does need to continue her heart worm treatment and has been a trooper through everything. I found her awaiting the euthanasia filthy, scarred and scabbed and nothing but skin and bones. Even being as malnourished as she was she has shown NO signs of food aggression towards people whatsoever but does let other dogs know when she does not feel like sharing. She is potty trained, kennel trained, and leash trained. Ellie is has a beautiful soul and its very clear to see once you look into her big brown eyes. Ellie is very patiently waiting for her forever home.  I was scheduled to be euthanized, but San Antonio Pets Alive! saved me and now they are helping me find the forever, loving home that I have never known.   I am currently located at San Antonio Pets Alive!, and I am in a foster home. By adopting me, you not only give me a new leash on life; you also save the life of the additional dog who can be rescued from euthanasia and placed in foster care.   If you are interested adopting, please email adopt@sanantoniopetsalive.org with Pet name and ID#. Please allow us up to 24 hours to respond as all fosters work with us on a volunteer basis.    To find out how you can get involved and help turn San Antonio into a no-kill city, please visit us at   www.sanantoniopetsalive.org

03/19/2016	Daisy - Rottweiler / Labrador Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrottie	Fairport, NY	Female	Posted Breed: Rottweiler / Labrador Retriever / Mixed. Daisy is a sweet 1 year old Rottweiler/Lab Mix. She was brought to the shelter because her family had too many pets. Daisy can be very shy at first but once he gets to know you he is a little bundle of love.  She is going to need a family who is committed to continuing her training using positive reinforcement techniques. She would do best in an active home where he can have lots of room to run and get in his daily training sessions.  While in foster care Daisy lived with other dogs and cats and did well with them. Daisy must go home with another dog as she looks to other dogs for confidence and guidance. Daisy would do best in a home without young children. If you are looking to add a sweet young lady to your home, come meet Daisy, she may be just the sweet lady you are looking for. Daisy is currently living in a foster home, so she is being shown by appointment only. If you are interested in meeting her please contact Jessica Parker at jparker@lollypop.org or 585-223-1330 x 160.

They need regular grooming and baths and heartworm prevention medicine every month for their entire lives. Depending on the breed, dogs can live to 20 years of age.

When RTR found me I had a swollen eye socket, a broken tail, an awful limb, no fat on my body and all my skin was falling off and bleeding and I was left in a trashcan. The lovely ladies down in Florida spent so many hours trying to clean me up and show me that I was in a safe place. After a few weeks I finally believed them and got all my energy back! I blossomed into this fantastic and loving puppy; all I want to do is run around and play with you or other dogs. I love ear rubs and if you stop I will push my big uncoordinated body against you to remind you that I'm still there. Life has been great with RTR -- I am happy, healthy, and even found a girlfriend ;-) We were play buddies every day! I can't wait to come home with you and continue to experience my ""second chance"" at life!

Name: Ely Breed: Shepherd mix Approximate Age: 1.5 years Approximate Weight: 60 lbs Sex: Male Hi there- Ely is my name and structure is my game!! Here is a little sneak peek in my life right now, when I wake up I jump on my foster moms bed for a little morning snuggle time. She will give me some belly rubs and kisses before we get up to start the day. After we get up comes breakfast, I can eat from a bowl, who cant? That to me is BORING, I like to work for my meals! We work on commands like; sit, down, look, place, up, and stay. My foster mom tells me I am super smart and she likes to challenge me to keep my mind sharp. Next comes outside time, man I could stay out there all day!  I am probably happiest outside running around, or hiking. There was this white stuff called snow and Holy Cow did I love that! I would roll around in it and make all sorts of tracks running and jumping through it. When we go inside sometimes I like to be left alone to just chill, don’t worry I will come up to you if I want some loving but if you see me laying down and relaxing please give me my space. I am looking forward to finding my perfect forever home, I don’t really care for cats, or kids that don’t know how to give space however, I do like playing with other dogs.  I can be left out in the house without destroying anything or making messes but my foster mom and I agree it’s nice to be in my crate when she is not home, that way she knows I am safe when she is at work. When she comes home from work then I go to work for my dinner, through the whole list of commands again I love when she mixes things up and really makes me work for it! At night I get to stay out of my crate and sleep in the living room, usually on the floor, I only go on the couch when I am invited and want some affection other than that.

We provide medical care for the animals at the Nevada County Shelter, making them adoptable, and we support other disadvantaged animals in Nevada County that would otherwise be euthanized to end their suffering. Sammie's Friends also operates the Nevada County Animal Shelter.  WE ARE A NO KILL SHELTER!Hi -My name is Jessie.I am a 3 year old pitbull who was abandoned.Sammie's Friends has done a good job of entertaining me since I arrived there quite a few months ago. I have also gone home many times with Beverley, the doggie behaviorist who works at Sammie's Friends. I like to go to Sammie's Pit Stop because there are a lot of dogs there and I get to play and I get to sleep on a bed in a room in a home instead of in a kennel. I really do need a permanent home where I can settle in and truly be someone's loyal dog friend or dog son (however you prefer to identify me). I have been getting better and better at playing with other dogs. The last few days I have made friends with Coco, Charlie and Umi and I have been having a ball. Beverley says I have to continue to prove myself before I can be left to play unsupervised with other dogs. I also get a little scared sometimes when I meet new people. I was adopted by a truck driver and went trucking with him, which was a lot of fun in the truck. However, we stopped at great big truck stops with huge trucks and people coming and going and it was a little too much for me. If I could have just been in the truck with my Dad and avoided all the chaos it would have been good. When I get scared I can get defensive and then I growl. I'm told that doesn't come across as friendly. However, at the shelter I have many human friends and do well with all of them. I have been interacted with by at least 50 different people with no problems. I'm just a little inflexible when it comes to strangers. I have all the basics - up to date on shots, neutered (ouch) heartworm negative and microchipped. The above was dictated by me to my friend, Cheryl so I could get some press and get a home. Please, just right person for me, come and get me.

This darling pooch is a happy girl with a charming, bubbly personality and a penchant for fun! Emma is super affectionate and loves belly rubs and discussing the days current events with you (shes very talkative!). She especially enjoys playtime, which often includes her tug toy and tennis balls. She knows the commands to sit and leave it, and if you entice her with treats shell be willing to learn more! Emma is strong enough that she would make a fabulous running or hiking partner, but shes sweet enough to lend an ear whenever you need someone to confide in. Shes waiting for that one lucky family to take her home and reap all the benefits of a precious lady such as herself

About DC PAWS Rescue:Our rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based dog and cat rescue in the DC area. We partner with a local rescuer in Pickens County, SC, who saves adoptable cats and dogs from the county’s animal control facility, which lacks the resources to facilitate adoptions to the public. Without a mechanism for local adoptions, all animals not claimed within the mandated hold period are euthanized. For the animals in this rural area, rescue is really the only lifeline. Our rescue partner not only works with DC PAWS to save as many dogs and cats as possible, but she has also established a successful spay/neuter clinic in the community to decrease the number of homeless and unwanted animals over the long term.BE A FOSTER:Fosters make it possible for DC PAWS to save and care for homeless, neglected and abandoned animals! To learn about fostering dogs or cats for DC PAWS Rescue, please contact us at: info@dcpawsrescue.org!http://dcpawsrescue.org/volunteer/fostering/foster-application/BE A SPONSOR:For any of our animals! Sponsors help us provide critical medical care, food, boarding and other support for animals facing euthanasia. Individuals who sponsor a dog or cat receive special recognition on the animal's profile.  Sponsorships can also be made in honor or memory of a loved one, and you may designate to whom DC Paws Rescue should provide notice of your gift.

About HHADR:  Our rescue dogs are saved from high kill shelters in MS, TN and AR. We also rescue from the surrounding Milwaukee, WI area. Most dogs are completely vetted in the south and then travel to our 2nd rescue in WI, although we also have 3 vet clinics in the Mukwonago area that we use. Our WI location is at 776 Swan Drive in Mukwonago. We do a monthly adoption event AND we show dogs BY APPOINTMENT ONLY the rest of the month. You MUST complete the adoption application and be approved before we will set up a meet and greet! Our ""main"" and/or founding location is in Crenshaw, MS, approximately an hour south of Memphis, TN. Our county has NO animal control, therefore we get a LOT of dogs and puppies dumped on our property and many, many of them are abandoned, abused, emaciated...just plain neglected their whole lives.... so of course we do anything and everything possible to get them ""adoptable"", but along with that comes 1000's and 1000's of dollars in vet bills. Our adoption fee is our main source of income, so please do not ask for a ""discount"". GO TO OUR WEBSITE TO GET THE ADOPTION APPLICATION: www.HooversHauseAllDogRescue.com You can also call or text Andrea at 262-888-0046.

(I wish I could count so I could tell you more precisely!) I am refining my manners and skills so I can be the most proper gentleman possible for my future family. I hate to brag, but I’ve already made tons of progress—I’m mastering sitting, staying, not barking, and not jumping. I come when called and even walk very nicely on leash. I adore other dogs, people, and kids. I am highly respectful of my kitty foster brother as well and let him rule the roost.

Terrance - Rottweiler/German Shepherd mix - 3 years old - male We found this handsome boy at an over-crowded shelter where his life was in danger due to lack of space. Terrance was owned by someone who got him as a cute puppy, but didn't want the responsibility of raising him. He was left outside, given no attention and then dumped. Stealing Hearts was happy to swoop Terrance up and give him the chance at a life with a family that will truly love him for the rest of his life. This big boy is so sweet and so desperate for love, he will throw himself into you and try to keep you with him. Everything he does is a new experience, he never got out of his backyard so now every time we get him out it's like a new adventure. Terrance can be a bit unsure at first but when given a little time he meets each new adventure with a big smile and wagging tail. He is currently at the boarding facility we use until a foster home opens up, but we know that he's very good in his kennel area and doesn't have any accidents. He's good with other dogs, not bad on a leash and definitely enjoys going for walks. Terrance is happy, playful and REALLY wants to be loved… doesn't everyone?? If you and your family have a lot of love to give, please consider giving some to our sweetheart Terrance.

03/19/2016	Henry - Shar Pei / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chinese Shar-Pei-Unknown Mix	Phoenix, AZ	Male	Posted Breed: Shar Pei / Mixed (medium coat). Henry - Shar-Pei Mix - 1 year old - Male Meet our handsome boy Henry! Henry was adopted as a small pup by a family that promised to love and care for him… sadly they did neither! After owning him for six months they returned him in horrible shape. His skin was raw, his hair falling out and he smelled so bad from infection. We found out that poor Henry had been left outside most of the time, his ears were covered with fly-bites. We felt horrible that we had placed him in such a bad home, they seemed so nice and lied so well! But now we have him back where he's safe and sound! He's been in a foster home so we could get him the medical attention he so desperately needed. Because Henry is a Shar-Pei mix, we are not surprised that he has some skin issues, basically allergies, but we were able to find a medication that works and his skin has cleared up and his hair is growing back, slowly, but he's well on his way to having the beautiful coat he had when he was a baby! His foster mom has done a wonderful job. Henry is happy, playful and she tells us a big goof! He is very smart and responsive to commands. Henry is an active boy and needs a home with a yard to play in and a person or family that will make sure he gets daily exercise. He would love a family that would take him camping, hiking or running with them. Henry is house-trained, crate trained and knows basic commands. He is also good with other dogs AND cats and love kids! If our sweet goofy boy sounds like a good fit for your family, please call Toni at 602-686-4158 or email azbullygirl@hotmail.com

However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. Further, because ""pit bull terrier type dog"" is not a breed we can list and because this dog has a blocky head and other characteristics that make the public perceive him/her as a pit bull, we are listing him/her as a pit bull mix. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.                "

Name: Jill Date of Birth: Approx. 03/15/2015 Gender: Female Breed: Great Pyr Weight: 65 Dog friendly: Yes, with intros Cat friendly: TBD Kid friendly: Yes House trained: TBD Crate trained: TBD Energy level: Moderate  History: Pulled from a high kill shelter Adoption Fee: $400  From the Foster:     Jill (Jill-y Bean as we call her) is as sweet as they come. She loves her people and if you show her some affection she will be yours forever. She is a little shy, but warms up pretty quickly and when she knows you will give her pets and snuggles, she'll melt right in.   She is a puppy in age, but acts more teenager in that she doesn't play a lot, but has her moments of squeaking a toy and tossing a ball. She is completely house trained and is crate trained. We haven't had her long and so haven't been leaving her out while we aren't home. We are going to see how that goes soon. We have left her out at night while we are sleeping and she has done great.   She loves our 2 1/2 year old son and is extremely gentle with him and she's his Jill-y. She has been sleeping in her crate at night as well and so far, unlike most Pyr, she isn't a barker at night. Or anytime for that matter. Initially she wasn't a fan of our resident dog Blu (husky mix) but after only 3 days she warmed up to him and they are BFFs.    She walks really well on a leash, but likes to smell everything as she is learning what the good life is. Because Great Pyrs can be escape artists, we have been using a soft harness on her and she has no issues with that while we walk.   All dogs are in individual foster homes throughout the Twin Cities.  FILL OUT AN APPLICATION TODAY! Click Here to Begin Appl icatio  n     If you live in MN, WI, IA, SD, ND, or IL and would like to meet/adopt this animal or anyone else, then please fill out an adoption application at  http://secondhandhounds.org/adoption-information/  and the foster(s) will be in touch! Keep in mind that there may be multiple applicants applying for the same animal(s).  You only need to complete 1 application for multiple animals that you're interested in.  Note   - We change an animal's listing to say ""PENDING ADOPTION"" when they already had a meet and greet with a family who plans to adopt   that animal. We put ""NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS"" on a listing when an animal has multiple applications in and the foster has asked to stop accepting any more while they review the applications they've already received.

Wendy is a sweet 1 &#189; year old Rottweiler mix, who weighs approximately 46 pounds. She was brought into the shelter because her family had too many pets. Wendy can be shy at first but once she gets to know you she loves to run and play. Wendy would do best in a home where she can get plenty of aerobic exercise. She would love to join you on long walks. Wendy has lived with dogs and cats in her previous home and did well with them. She would do best in a home with another happy, confident dog she can look to for guidance and support. Wendy can be nervous when meeting new people; because of this she would do best in a home without young children. If you are looking to add a girl who is sure to make you smile every day, come and meet Wendy, she may be just what you are looking for.

He knows how to sit and will respond to ""lay down"" if you have a treat in your hand.    Sampson's adoption fee is $200. He is neutered, UTD on vaccinations, microchipped, and on flea/tick/heartworm prevention.

03/19/2016	Jack - German Shorthaired Pointer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shorthaired Pointer	Newton, KS	Male	Posted Breed: German Shorthaired Pointer (short coat). Hello, my name's Jack! Are you looking for someone who would love to go on walks or jogs around town with you? Well then don't look any further, because I would love to be the one to fulfill that wish. I am a very active gentleman that loves to run, chase, and play. In fact, some of my favorite toys are balls, frisbee's, and soft squeaky toys. However, if aren't capable of taking me on walks every day, if you have a big backyard where someone will take me outside and run and play with me, I would enjoy that just as much. However, you'll have to make sure that you have a secure fence because I get bored easily and tend to escape. So in addition, it might be a good idea if someone comes out and watches me while I'm outside. Speaking of outside, in my previous house I was mostly an outside dog, however I am mostly housebroken, but every once in a while I will have an accident inside. Though if you continue to work with me, I'm sure that I can become fully housebroken. Speaking out of working with me, I haven't really had any training, and could definitely benefit from some obedience classes. Since I need help leaning not to jump on people, not to jump up on the counters, to walk better on a leash, to stay out of the trash can, and just some of the basic commands. I'm a very smart boy that loves to learn, and am also very food motivated, so with the right trainer/person I don't think I'll have a problem learning how do any of these thing. In my previous house I live with three other dogs and was playful with all of them, and when I meet another dog here at the shelter I did pretty well with him also. So if you are looking for a dog that is very energetic and always the go, but who also has a very affectionate side and loves to give kisses, then come on down and meet me. In fact, I have a feeling that if you willing to put in some time, training, and effort with me, you're going to end up with an amazing dog, and you won't regret it!

Name: Lady Age: Approximate DOB 9/16/14 Gender: Female Breed: Pointer/Dalmatian mix  Weight: 47 pounds Dog friendly: Yes Cat friendly: Unknown Kid friendly: Yes House trained: TBD Crate trained: TBD Energy level: TBD History: Stray in KY  Adoption Fee: $300  From the Foster: Lady Seeks out a lap to lay on....yes, complete body leaning and laying on a lap! She needs to be VERY close to her humans to feel secure. That is also what she seeks out at night. She does breathe and snore pretty loudly but can not hear herself.❤️  She does not have a good sense of her body in space so can hurt you or mouth you not realizing what she is doing. Bull in a china shop!  When you take her outside she is afraid she will be left outside so the only way she will go potty is if you walk outside and walk around the yard until she is done.  She also was most likely hit so someone needs to be very careful about being gentle and patient with her so she can feel secure and not afraid. When I raise my hand to get her attention she sometimes flinches thinking my hand is going to come down on her to hurt her  It is a lot of getting her attention by tapping her back of her body and making eye contact with hand gestures so she understands.  I really think she is wonderful but just too much for our family of young kids and cats. She would do really well being the only one or with a very tolerable dog who is already very obedient and listens. She can get really riled up and have a hard time settling down. Dog play is just too fun for her!! Oh, and she of course can't hear growls or sounds of the playmate so can't read signs from the other dog.   All dogs are in individual foster homes throughout the Twin Cities.              I f you would like to meet/adopt this animal or anyone else, then please fill out an adoption application at http://secondhandhounds.org/adoption-information/ and the foster(s) will be in touch! Keep in mind that there may be multiple applicants applying for the same animal(s). You only need to complete 1 application for multiple animals that you're interested in.              Note  - We change an animal's listing to say ""PENDING ADOPTION"" when they already had a meet and greet with a family who plans to adopt that animal. We put ""NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS"" on a listing when an animal has multiple applications in and the foster has asked to stop accepting any more while they review the applications they've already received.                               If you would like to be a foster for Secondhand Hounds, then please fill out a foster application,  http://secondhandhounds.org/fostervolunteer-information/fostering-101/  You can choose the type of animal you'd like to foster and we will supply everything you need (food, collar, bowls, crate, etc.) while the animal is in your care.

William Thomason BywayLeitchfield, KY 42754 The shelter is open daily from 8:00AM to 12:00PM (Central Time Zone). Please contact us for an appointment if these times aren't suited to your schedule.3-14-16 Pappy went for his neuter and to have the growths removed from his side, toe and foot. He is heartworm negative and his shots are now up to date. Current weight is 51.6 Pappy showed up at someone's house in deplorable condition. She tried to find the owner by posting just general information to see who might respond. Someone then contacted her saying they had seen someone dropping a boxer not far from her home. It was just a day after that when he showed up at her house. She took him to the vet to check out the growth on his side and his general condition, The vet estimated him to be 5 or 6 years old but could not be certain. She kept him for a while to fatten him up and improve his condition. A family offered to give him a home and he did well, but the landlord said he had to go. The woman then turned to us to see if we can help. Pappy will get his shots and be heartworm tested and his growth will be removed from his side. The places that look raw on his hips are from being on concrete (most likely) and the thinness of his skin where the hip bones are located. Will know more about him in a few days and will update. He is fine with other dogs and children and was not concerned with the cats. He needs a good home where he can be appreciated for the very nice dog he is.Can't adopt but want to help?Please visit the following pages on our main website:  Become A Grayson Angel Foster Info Rescue Info Sponsorship Info Volunteering Info Wish List  You can also help us help the Grayson animals by joining the Friends of the Grayson County Humane Society Yahoo Group and our FaceBook page!Paypal donations can be made directly to the shelter by simply clicking on the donate button below.

Handsome Duke is looking for a kingdom to reign over. This noble Shepherd/Chow Chow mix is well mannered and super smart. In true royal fashion, he likes to keep his possessions all to himself and sometimes tries to escape the yard to explore other kingdoms, so a fenced yard is a must. But don't let his noble demeanor fool you - he spends his down time running around, playing, hoping for ear scratches and napping in his very own fashion: upside down, feet straight up to the sky!

Name: Moe  Breed: Labrador mix Approximate Age: 3-4 yrs. Approximate Weight: 46 lbs. Currently Living at: Shelter in South Carolina; Moe can't wait to come to D.C. and find his FURever home! Meet handsome Moe! This 3-4 year old Labrador mix, weighing in at approximately 46 lbs., found himself at a shelter through no fault of his own. Now he's on his way to D.C. and looking to find the perfect family to call his own! Moe's previous owners passed away, and now he's been patiently waiting for a new and loving home -- could it be yours? Moe will need plenty of exercise and playtime each day to be a happy and healthy pup (He is a Labrador mix after all!) He would love to go on long walks and regular trips to the dog park. After he's tuckered out, Moe loves curling up for a nice nap and belly rub. He can't wait to go to obedience training with his new family so that he can bond with his people and become his very best self! Although Moe loves people and gets along well with other dogs, we haven't had a chance to see him interact with kids yet. If you have them, let us know, and we'll do our best to find out! Moe will make a great companion and family member; you won’t regret opening your heart and home to this sweet boy! Like most shelter dogs, Moe may need a refresher on house-training. He is likely crate trained. The adoption fee for this dog is $350, which includes the cost of routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay/neuter.

03/19/2016	*BOSTON - Rottweiler (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler	Sacramento, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Rottweiler (medium coat). When Boston came to the shelter, his eyes were very bad and they had to be removed. He is a very social and people oriented pup, and does great with other dogs large and small. You might wonder if owning a blind dog requires special attention.. not really! Boston finds his way around new environments very well. He is cautious at first, of course, but eventually moves around the house like any other dog. He is house trained, and uses doggy doors to go outside to the bathroom. He walks well on leash, and would benefit from being in a home with a canine companion.

About HHADR:  Our rescue dogs are saved from high kill shelters in MS, TN and AR. We also rescue from the surrounding Milwaukee, WI area. Most dogs are completely vetted in the south and then travel to our 2nd rescue in WI, although we also have 3 vet clinics in the Mukwonago area that we use. Our WI location is at 776 Swan Drive in Mukwonago. We do a monthly adoption event AND we show dogs BY APPOINTMENT ONLY the rest of the month. You MUST complete the adoption application and be approved before we will set up a meet and greet! Our ""main"" and/or founding location is in Crenshaw, MS, approximately an hour south of Memphis, TN. Our county has NO animal control, therefore we get a LOT of dogs and puppies dumped on our property and many, many of them are abandoned, abused, emaciated...just plain neglected their whole lives.... so of course we do anything and everything possible to get them ""adoptable"", but along with that comes 1000's and 1000's of dollars in vet bills. Our adoption fee is our main source of income, so please do not ask for a ""discount"". GO TO OUR WEBSITE TO GET THE ADOPTION APPLICATION: www.HooversHauseAllDogRescue.com You can also call or text Andrea at 262-888-0046. She approves ALL applications  AND FINALLY, WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR DOG:  Alex is a blue and white pit bull, who is currently 2 years old as of today (3/13/2016). We rescued this handsome man after he was found roaming the streets in Memphis, TN and literally starving to death! He has gained almost 15 pounds since rescue and is STILL in need of at least 10 more pounds. Alex was super sick with infections from several wounds, and spent almost 4 weeks at the vet to recover. He's now completely healthy. He only needs to gain more much needed weight! Alex is a total LOVE bug! He adores all dogs and really, really enjoys being with his person and laying on his doggie bed with a good chew toy! Alex looks a little muddy in his photos....well, that's cuz he is! Not only have we had a ton of rain lately in the south....but he LOVES the water and it is difficult to keep him out of the puddles! As always, we never guarantee the breed OR the size they'll be as an adult. Alex will be at our Adoption Event on March 26th at our Rescue Center in Mukwonago. We are at 776 Swan Drive and the adoption event is from 10-4P.

If you're interested in any of our wonderful dogs, please go to our website to fill out an adoption application. Once we receive it we'll forward it to the foster family for follow up. We are 100% foster based, so we don't have a facility. Review the process at our website.  Adoption applications can be found here: http://labrescuefresno.org/available-labs/adoption-application/  Adoption Fees Adult Dog (10 mos. – 7 years): $250.00  Puppy (9 mos. and under): $350.00 Senior (8 yrs. and up)/Special Needs Dog: $100.00  The Great Gatsby - The Chocolate Collection 1 Year Old Male, 70lbs Just in time for Easter, the Labrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno presents the Chocolate Collection. Third in our series, fresh out of West Egg, we have The Great Gatsby! Full of life and fun, Gatsby never meets a stranger.  Ta-da! My I present myself, The Great Gastby! Life is too short to do anything but enjoy every minute of it! I'm a happy, happy guy who's whole bucket list includes finding my forever family, playing, and meeting as many friends as I possibly can. What is better than having friends and family to love and be loved by? Nothing! Cuddling, loving, playing, walks in the sun. I have the basics - potty trained, the crates ok, but I would love for you to teach me some more.  Say the word, and I am ready to bound joyfully into your life, your heart, and together we will rediscover the meaning of unconditional love. If you are wondering about me, don't look back - it's not about the past, but what you make of the future. For me, for whatever reason, the place I used to live just let me wander away.  They just didn't have any joy or love in their hearts, so don't feel sad for me - I am much better off without them. You see, there are good people in the world, and a good Samaritan found me. After no one came looking for me, she introduced me to real, live hero's on Earth - the Defenders of Dogs, the Legends of Labs, the Labrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno. Now, my life is nothing but roses! Four legged foster brother and sisters to help show me the ropes. People who pet on me and cuddle me and promise me the moon. And soon, my very own family - could it be you?  Gatsby is available for adoption through the Labrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno. Like all young Labrador's, he is still a bit of a puppy and will require training and regular exercise to help him develop into all that he was meant to be. Strong and healthy, he gets along well with people and dogs his size with proper introductions and has a big, puppy heart. There is no cat or small dog in his foster home so it is unknown how he will behave.  If you would like to give this handsome hunk of a pup a home, please fill out an application at our website: http://www.labrescuefresno.org/ And from all of us at the Labrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno, thank you for your continued support.

03/19/2016	Buddy *NEW* - Boxer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Woodbury, MN	Male	Posted Breed: Boxer (short coat). Buddy (the Budster, Budski) is in a need of a home that will exercise him and play with him consistently. He needs to get his energy out to be the best boy inside the house that he can be. Buddy loves kids, but may play a bit rough when he is overly excited. He is highly trainable and only wants to please his family. He wants to play with other dogs, but will need some socialization so he doesn't just charge up and start jumping on the other dog to play. Buddy did very well in getting aclimated with the other big playful dog at the foster home. Buddy is crate-trained. His fur is a little thin and course in places so Buddy will start on a limited ingredient diet to see if that helps. Buddy is going to make a great dog for the family that can walk or jog with him, teach him a few manners, and have lots of time to play with him. Is that you?

03/19/2016	Izzo - Labrador Retriever Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever	Denton, TX	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever. This beautiful young boy has just arrived at his foster home...but here's a few things we've already learned. Izzo is very athletic and could probably dunk a ball as well as Denzel Valentine, but we're going to stick to his LOVE of fetch. Throw the ball - he will bring it right back and drop it in your hand so you can throw the ball again and again and again...   He does not like the crate, so we're going to work on that while he's here. He is housebroken and knows some basic commands, but will benefit from some focused obedience lessons.  He's going to be a big guy when he stops growing and fills out, so good manners is really important for him. Izzo is a typical high energy Lab and will do best in an active home with older children and a big yard that will give him the exercise and playtime that he loves.           How do I adopt? If you are interested in adopting from TSBR - please review our adoption process and complete an adoption application. We require an application and home visit prior to being considered for adoption.

Our adoption contract requires that all dogs (or puppies) be spayed/neutered within one month of adoption, or when age appropriate. You are asked to notify us when and by who this surgery will be performed. Our volunteers will verify that the dog has been spayed/neutered. If you fail to spay/neuter, as outlined in the adoption contract you signed, our organization will take appropriate measures to reclaim the dog.

Pet Helpers is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foster based volunteer rescue located in Fairmont, WV. We do adopt out of state to approved applicants, if you are willing to drive to WV to pick up your pet. We do not fly or use transport companies. Our adoption fee is $150.00 for mixed breed puppies and adult dogs, $225.00 for full blooded puppies and adult dogs and $50.00 for cats and kittens. Regardless if the animal is a mixed breed or full blooded they are spayed/neutered prior to adoption IF they are old enough. If they are too young at the time of adoption, then it is your financial responsibility to spay/neuter the pet by the age of 6 months and you must provide proof for our files that it has been done. All of our pets are checked by a vet, given the shots appropriate for their age and any other treatment deemed necessary by the vet. All of our pets are adopted as indoor pets and are not be outdoors tied to a box 24/7. The pet you are adopting has been living in a home with a foster family. You are expected to take possession of the pet you are applying for within a few days of application approval. This will enable us to accept another pet into that home. Because we are a rescue, and believe that spaying and neutering is crucial in stopping the reproduction of unwanted puppies/kittens and massive amounts of animals dying daily in shelters across the country, we expect any animal already in your home to be spayed/neutered. If for any reason you are unable to keep the pet you have adopted you are required to return them to Pet Helpers, Inc. They are not to be sold or given away.   Check us out on Facebook!!!!!! We hope you will give us two paws up, like our page and share with your friends. Pet Helpers, Inc.

He was picked up while roaming around a neighborhood with his canine friend. He is quite submissive when approached and will immediately roll onto his back for belly rubs. We have kenneled Teddy with other dogs, but he isn''t receptive to any new dogs being added to the run. He seems to be a creature of habit and adding new friends upsets his balance. The hustle and bustle of an ever changing kennel just isn''t the right place for Teddy. He needs a secure and permanent place where he can relax and regain his confidence. Teddy is a lover boy and will make a great addition to most any household.

03/19/2016	K C (AUBURN) SUPER FRIENDLY PLAYFUL BOY - Labrador Retriever / Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Seattle, WA	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Mixed. Meet KC... an 85lb, 4yr old Lab mix... although we haven't seen much of the 'mix!' He seems to be all Lab in his silly, friendly ways. He loves to play fetch, for hours if he could, and he loves the water. And he's always up for a walk, car ride or hiking trip. If he needs to stay home alone for up to 8hrs by himself before he gets to play fetch, that's ok with him, too. KC is a loving, family friendly boy that needs a back yard to play in and maybe a few cats with which to cuddle. He's ok with other dogs, too... but prefers to be the only dog in the home. He gets a little anxious with the energy of small children so kids must be over 10yrs old. We only have KC's shelter intake photo at this time but will be updating with new pix soon.  If you would like to meet this handsome fun boy please email tamera@k9rr.com and include your phone number.

Please contact C.A.R.E. for more information about this pet.Ghost American Bulldog Mix, 2 - 3 years old, Neutered male. My original family had to give me up because the other dog in the house was always mean to me. They really wanted me to live in a safer, calmer home than what they could provide. Because of that one dog, I have come to regard other dogs with caution—some, I like, but others make me nervous. My foster mom has been happy to see how well I’m getting along with the dogs in my foster family. She let me meet one of the dogs in their back yard. After some nose-sniffing, that dog and I agreed to ignore each other. I can be timid in new situations and will rely on you, my new mom or dad, to give me reassurance and guidance. I know basic obedience commands and am a perfect gentleman on the leash. My perfect person will be someone who’s patient and willing to help me regain my confidence. In return, I am ready to bond with you and be your forever dog.  Adoption Information: Size: Large / weighs 65 lbs Children: Yes Dogs: Possibly, Ghost is selective Cats: Yes Housebroken: Yes, and crate-trained Obedience: Attendance in D.O.G.

To make the adoption process faster and easier, please visit www.caninelifeline.org to submit an online application.Meet Wally, a very handsome 4 year-old Aussie/Husky mix male with beautiful sky blue eyes. He’s sure to turn a lot of heads in the neighborhood when he’s out for a walk. Wally is not only handsome but has a fantastic disposition to go with his good looks. He found himself homeless at a rural county dog shelter so made the trip to Canine Lifeline so he would have more time to find the perfect new home. Wally gets along well with other dogs but he might be fine as the only dog in his home too. He seems to prefer the company of his human friends to playing with other dogs. Wally does well in his crate and may be housetrained too although we can’t guarantee it. For a big guy, he walks quite well on a leash and, with a little more practice, is sure to be walking like a pro. Wally weighs about 80 pounds but needs to lose about 10-15 pounds to be at his ideal weight. His adoption fee is $200. Wally’s neutered, current on monthly heartworm preventative, up to date on vaccinations, wormed, on flea preventative, and microchipped. All Canine Lifeline adoptions come with a two-week trial period to make sure it’s a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you’re interested in Wally. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. All of our dogs come to us from county dog pounds so we have no history on them. We also have no foster homes with young children so aren’t comfortable placing any of them in a home with children less than 4-5 years of age. We try to respond to inquiries within 24-48 hours so if you haven’t heard from us within that time frame, please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn’t landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Wally and to submit an online application.Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/2015/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.

Please contact Dog (dogapplications@yahoo.com) for more information about this pet.  Meet Neroh! Neroh is a two-year-old pit mix who is very sweet and affectionate and he weighs approximately 60 pounds. He is house and crate trained, but he is not a big fan of the crate. Neroh has lived with both male and female dogs but would prefer having a female sister. He is not great with sharing his food and toys with other dogs, but does take correction from the female dog. As far as humans, the foster is able to put his hands near or in his food and take away toys with no problems. We were told that he lived with a five year old child in the past and absolutely adored him. He has lived with a cat but he didn't do well, therefore we would not recommend a house with cats. He would do best in a home that has good leadership and dog handling skills. A fenced in yard is also mandatory for his forever home!   Neroh's adoption fee is $250 and includes all vetting and neuter.

My name is River, I am a 3 year old Collie Samoyed mix. I am a big girl at 65lbs. I am on a little diet. Like my name I am a calm and peaceful beauty. Right now I am still very timid and shy. I am a very sweet and soft and I love treats, especially chicken. I do great with other dogs and really enjoy being with them, so far i ignore cats.I need an understanding human, who will take the time to let me get to know and love them at my own pace. I prefer a quieter home. Older dog savvy kids would be fine, but they must understand sometimes those quick movements scare me. I would prefer a home with another older, confident dog, who can help show me the ropes. Right now people and new places scare me, and I just keep to myself. I would love it if my new people continued training with my foster mom, it is really important, the loyal canine inc is her business and she really wants to see me loved and able to open up. I am crate trained, well behaved on leash, and love to lay outside in the grass. I need a lot of confidence building and that's what we have been working on so far!As you can see I have a VERY soft, fluffy, beautiful coat. I came in very matted and needed parts shaved down. Since I have a double coat, I will need regular brushing and grooming so that my coat grows back how it is supposed to, and I don't end up a tangled mess. I was scared but very sweet and well behaved for the groomer and the vet. If you are a patient and calm dog owner. You would be lucky to have this girl. She is going to blossom into an amazing girl and is one of those once in a lifetime kind of dog. If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out the Online Application!

How To Adopt | Adoption Application | Pet Inquiry Form | Long Distance Adoptions A.A.R.F. (All About Rescue and Fixin' Inc.) http://aarf-tn.com/ is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) no kill animal rescue organization located in the Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. A.A.R.F. is comprised of unpaid volunteers and survives only on public donations. Adoption donations vary and are subject to change without notice. Thank you for thinking adoption first! Prior to adoption, all canines and felines are spayed or neutered, have received their age appropriate vaccinations, have been de-wormed for common parasites, and have received treatment for prevention of fleas and ticks. All canines over the age of 6 months have been tested for heartworm. All canines are put on heartworm prevention as soon as possible - this means dogs as soon as they are tested negative. Puppies are put on prevention immediately. All felines, regardless of age, have been tested for feline leukemia and FIV. Each animal receives a health check by a licensed veterinarian prior to adoption. Anything else found will be treated by our organization prior to adoption.                
03/19/2016	Paisley - German Shepherd Dog / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog-Unknown Mix	Livonia, MI	Female	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog / Mixed. If interested in any of our animals for adoption, or to foster an animal, please fill out the respective application to get the process started. Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.   Hi, my name is Paisley! I came to LDDR from our friends at CHAINED after spending my entire life chained to a fence outside. Once CHAINED realized I had given birth to a litter of seven beautiful puppies outside in the elements, they were able to talk my owners into allowing us into the garage until I could wean my babies. They saved our lives by getting us out of the cold, and soon after, they were able to get my owners to turn us all over to LDDR to be put in foster care to find our forever homes!        Because I spent my entire life until now outside by myself, I am still warming up to the idea of humans. I’m a bit nervous and shy, but I only took a couple of hours to settle into my foster mom’s house. She gives me yummy treats and plays with me, so I follow her around and don’t like her to be without me around the house!       I do well in a crate once I’m tired out, so that is where I sleep. It seems to make me feel more secure because it has a big fluffy blanket in it and is covered with a sheet, so sometimes I even go in there to relax with the door open. I’m still getting used to the idea of a house, and sometimes I think that everything belongs to me and like to steal things like socks and papers if they’re left out. I am NOT destructive though, I just need to be taught what I can and cannot have!       I’ve been around other dogs and I LOVE them. I absolutely would not mind having a fur brother or sister of my own.        As a formerly chained dog, it is important that I learn that I am safe now, and will never have to return to that kind of life. I appreciate the little things like being handed treats (I take them very gently), lots of walks outside (there is so much to explore!), scratches behind the ears, and playing games. Spend time with me, and you’ll win me over in no time! I need a family who will be patient with me as I learn, and who will teach me things and allow me to jump in the car with them to go for rides. Will you be that family?      Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all dogs before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the dog's shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the dog is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Dogs MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our dogs back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted dog.    The  petfinder.com  system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.    Thank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes. We appreciate you stopping by.

OK for kids over: 14Activity Preference: Low maintenance overall but needs quality outside time.IQ: AveragePete's favorite things: Loves his crate, treats and a good bone.Pete is good at: meeting people, meeting dogs, staying in a crate, behaving in the house, going for car rides, walking on a leash, cuddling, following commandsIdeal home: no children, quiet environment, other: His new home would be open to learning how to care for a blind dog and, in particular, learning about Pete.Training Needs: Health issues: Pete is completely blind from Progressive Retinal Atrophy. Meet Pete Handsome Pete is a joy to have here with us. He is very chill and likes to relax. So far he doesn't seem interested in toys just treats and bones. He loves his crate. He stays nearby me and takes comfort in a trusted human's presence. He is completely house trained. Goes for walks. He is so precious, he ""watches"" the birds when we are outside. He seems to know a few commands that help him get around like ""watch"" ""step"" and ""wait"". He likes hearing sound. Talking to him seems to calm him – coming into an unfamiliar home and learning the layout is stressful – he is doing great but gets ""lost"" sometimes. Pete will need to be taken outside on a leash when outside for his bathroom breaks even if you have a fenced yard. Overall, Pete is a super handsome, easy-going, big boy who is a love!

03/19/2016	Spice - Mastiff / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mastiff-Unknown Mix	Brunswick, GA	Female	Posted Breed: Mastiff / Mixed (short coat). DOB: 3/4/2012      Spice was dumped inside our gate, along with another dog we never laid eyes on. We aren't sure why, because she is just an absolute sweetheart. Maybe her owners could no longer care for them. Whatever the reason for discarding her, she has been taken under our wing and spayed, microchipped and given her core vaccines. She is also heartworm negative. We would love for her to find a new and loving home where she will be cherished and given a chance to spice up someone's life!

03/19/2016	Cali - Shepherd / Hound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Alpharetta, GA	Female	Posted Breed: Shepherd / Hound / Mixed (short coat). Cali is 2 ½ years old and weighs 55 lbs. She is one of the smartest, fastest and most agile dogs you will ever meet. She LOVES dogs of all shapes and sizes, especially those at doggie daycare. She loves the cat but can be a bit overwhelming if kitty’s not in the mood. Cali loves people and especially loves children. Cali knows her commands, listens very well and will sit and wait politely for her meals. She walks well on a leash but will chase a squirrel if given the opportunity. Because of her intelligence and young age, Cali needs a lot of exercise and family interaction and attention. She would do best in a home with other playful dogs and any age children. Cali would make a wonderful hiking companion, agility dog and/or pet therapy dog. She has been preparing for her Canine Good Citizen test. She needs a job where she can use her brain or she will find mischief on her own. Cali comes with free training to the family who gives Cali a forever home. Cali’s adoption fee is $275 [senior citizens (age 62 and older) and military personnel receive a 15% discount on adoption fees].  If you want to know more about Cali and to speak to an Adoption Counselor, please complete an application at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application.

Because most of our adoptable dogs were previously in shelters, we can’t be 100% sure of a dog’s breed mix, and unless there is a specific date of birth listed, we can’t be 100% sure of a dog’s age. Additionally, our assessments of a dog's interactions with other dogs, cats, or children are based on OUR experiences. Your experience may differ.

03/19/2016	King Arthur - Labrador Retriever / Golden Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Labrador	Kennesaw, GA	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Golden Retriever / Mixed. ROYAL THEMED DOG: 5 years old / 65 lbs. (needs to gain a bit more weight) I'm King Arthur, and I sure am happy to be at the Mostly Mutts shelter with lots of nice folks who give me attention, good food and lots of love. My previous owner kept me in the neighbor's fenced yard, and when they moved, she dropped me off at animal control and that was that. I was very skinny and am slowly gaining the weight I need. It's great here, but I can't wait to find my own family who will really show me what it's like to be a family member. I look forward to soft beds, nice walks and just hanging out with my people. BTW, I walk really well on a leash! I'm currently working on my house training as its very new to me, so please be prepared to patiently teach me where to potty. I seem to be a little head shy, like when you're putting a slip leash on me and being physically restrained is super uncomfortable for me, so no big hugs please. Just give me time to settle in and figure things out and we'll have a wonderful life together! I'm food protective and did bite a volunteer's hand when it was too close to my food, perhaps because I was so skinny when I came in, I may feel that I need to defend my food. I'm sorry about that and I'll try to do better. I do however take treats gently. I seem fine with other dogs as we pass each other by on walks, so with proper introduction, I may do well with another dog in my new home. No kid's please since I bite over food and do not like to be physically restrained or hugged tightly. Energy level: 4 – 6. I'm current on vaccinations, neutered and my adoption fee is $195.00. You can meet me Saturdays from 11:00 – 4pm at the Barrett Parkway PetSmart, 860 Cobb Place Blvd.

I'm a wonderful family dog who loves everyone and has a very sweet disposition! I've been loved my whole life, but my family lost their home and jobs so they can no longer care for me properly. No-one can believe I'm 8 years old as I act half my age! I like other dogs and am good with kids, although best no toddlers that I may bump over. I came in my friend Cooper if you would like to consider 2 wonderful Boxers. Mostly Mutts can give you a $50.00 discount if you would like to adopt us together, but we don't have to be adopted together.

03/19/2016	Hugh and Flannery - Golden Retriever (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Retriever	Los Angeles, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Golden Retriever (medium coat). Meet Hugh (7 years), and Flannery (6 years). These two big beautiful boys are very bonded, having lived together their entire lives. I put the emphasis on big, as both of these boys, due to too much bad food and too little physical activity, have found themselves quite large, to say the least. Hugh is the elder of the two, and he came in tipping the scales at 108 lbs. He is now down to about 100, and still needs to lose about 20 more lbs. Flannery, the 6 y/o, came in at 104, and is now down to 92. They will definitely need to continue with their weight loss regimen, but for now, just more of them to love. Both of these boys are as sweet as can be, loving, playful and friendly, with Hugh being the more assertive of the two. He does like to let a new dog know that he is in charge-he is dominant, but not in an aggressive manner. Neither seems to have had any type of training, although they know sit and shake. They have relatively good house manners, and are completely housebroken, but certainly not above a little counter surfing or food snatching , if given the opportunity. They really do not care to be left outdoors alone for long-they were probably left there a great deal of the time, if not always, and their preference is definitely clear-they will become anxious and paw at the door. They have been left alone for up to 8 hours , with the only results being some chewed paper on their foster mom’s return (unfortunately, some of that paper was money.lol). Neither has any separation anxiety. They are not big barkers, but they will let you know if they hear something or if someone comes to the door. They could use a little work on their leash manners-they are both very strong and curious, and start off puling, but soon settle down to a more comfortable walk. While they love each other very much, they can be a little toy and food possessive-they are fed separately, and their foster mom always makes sure to have lots of their favorite toys around, like tennis balls and kong toys, so they each have plenty to entertain themselves with. They enjoy car rides, and laying on the couch and snuggling with you-they fancy themselves large lap dogs! They also really enjoy being loved on. These boys are extremely bonded, and they will be adopted together-we will not separate them. If you would like to give these beautiful boys a home together, and have submitted both your on line application and have already had your home interview, please contact their rep at bodie99@cox.net  If you have already had a home interview and are interested in meeting, please email at bodie99@cox.net .

03/19/2016	Dapper Dan - Hound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Wakefield, RI	Male	"Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed (short coat). Age: 5 Years Weight: 53 lbs    This dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.     Hello out there! Around here they call me Dapper Dan! Hey, they call it as they see it! I'm believed to be a Hound mix born in December 2010. I am crate trained and leash trained, but since I only have experienced living at a shelter I will need to be house trained. I will need a patient person who will understand that it may take some time for me to transition from a shelter to a home. I am good with other dogs and I have met some felines which made me apprehensive at first, then mildly curious and once I figured out they were kinda cool I was alright with them. I am said to be a ""gentle old soul in a young dogs body,"" I'm not sure what that means, all I know is that I'm a dog that never had a family to love me and no family to love back. I would love to have someone take me for walks, not too far, a walk around the neighborhood would please me. A fenced in yard would be nice, if not I would need other ways for some off leash exercise. I may be 5 years old, but I still like those toys that squeak, and I like to play fetch now and then. No worries though, I have a moderate energy level, as I'm over those rambunctious puppy years. I'm more into sitting with my people and getting some loving, but I'm not that overly needy type either, I don't mind being alone. I am smart, but I have not had any obedience training. I would love to go and learn some commands and really make you proud of me.    Before living at the shelter, my siblings and I were living under a trailer of some nardowells and when they were kicked out the man who ran the park found us and brought us to the shelter. My siblings all found homes and now I hope I will too. If you would like to give me the home I never had, please fill out an application...Thank you and I hope to see you soon! Yours truly, Dapper Dan   Adoption Fee: $370   To apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/   **Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

His foster mom wonders if he was named Presley because he loves to sing/talk to his humans! Though he is highly food motivated which makes training easy and he has zero food aggression. He is still working on house training but he’s a smart dog and very eager to please, so he’s catching on quick and well on his way to being accident-free. He is not a fan of his crate but he is young and learning the house rules. His foster mom is working on teaching him that it the crate is a safe place by making it comfy with good treats and toys. We believe Presley is 1 ½ - 2 years old and likely a German Shepherd and Australian Shepherd mix. He’s healthy, up to date on his vaccines and neutered. Presley’s ideal home would be one with other playful dogs in the home as he’s incredibly social. We would love to see him adopted with his foster brother Wilson, as they’ve become the best of friends in this journey. But they don’t have to be adopted together.

03/19/2016	Sampson - Black Labrador Retriever / English Shepherd / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	English Shepherd-Unknown Mix	St Paul, MN	Male	"Posted Breed: Black Labrador Retriever / English Shepherd / Mixed. My name is Sampson and I am a loving 1 year old black lab mix. I am about 60 lbs. and should not get any bigger. I was found by the Human Society, so my history is unknown, but I am certainly happy in my new foster home! In fact, my loving human thinks I am a wonderful pooch! I try to match the energy of who I am surrounded by, ranging from high energy excitement to low energy- lying around. I really enjoy other dogs, but I have not been able to interact with any cats. I am still young and learning about my body, so sometimes I might knock things off coffee tables with my tail or jump up to show love; I am working on it though! Overall I believe I am lovable, relaxed, food motivated, and I always aim to please. I can never get enough pets; when you think you're down petting me I'll nudge your hand to let you know I want more. This is what my foster parents have to say about me:  To our pleasant surprise, Sampson has some basic training skills down: potty-trained, sit, lie down, 'leave it,' and 'no.' He's also been working on kennel training. With a treat Sampson jumps right into his kennel. Also, throughout the day/evening, he'll lie in his kennel on his own. He is very food and treat motivated, but not food aggressive. One thing Sampson will need a little more training on is walking on a leash. Sampson loves to explore and excited to move ahead when on walks, but continued diligent training can easily manage any concerns. With some training and time, Sampson has great potential to be a ""Good Canine Citizen,"" ""Companion Animal,"" or a Therapy Dog. Sampson would do best in an active home and/or a home with a backyard. He loves to nap and get attention, but enjoys walking/running/ generally being active. He would do wonderful as an only dog or a home with multiple dogs. He may do best in a home with children 5 and older as he is still learning that his size can potentially knock people off balance if they are not prepared. Overall, he's a giant teddy bear waiting to make a household happy.

03/19/2016	Boomer - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Ann Arbor, MI	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Boomer has one cute derpy little face! He has a cheek to cheek smile that is guaranteed to brighten your day. Boomer would be an excellent companion for someone looking for a best friend. He would love to go on leisurely strolls with you and do lots of exploring! New situations can be a bit stressful for him, so his new BFF will need to give him some time to adjust and help him find his brave side. This super loveable boy can&#39;t wait to meet you!<br/><br/>Boomer has heartworm which means that this dog has parasitic worms in the right ventricle of the heart and nearby blood vessels. Heartworm is transmitted from one dog to another by mosquitoes and can be easily prevented using monthly heartworm preventative, but once the disease is contracted the treatment process can be quite intensive. Boomer will need to remain sedentary with minimal activity during the treatment process to ensure a healthy recovery. There is additional information on heartworm disease and treatment available at our Adoption Desk.

Please contact Sue Caley (suec@luckydoganimalrescue.org) for more information about this pet.ADOPTION NOW PENDING FOR JERSEY!JERSEY NOW HAS ADOPTERS WAITING FOR HIS ARRIVAL!  WE ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR THIS DOG.  Please check our website (listed below) for more great dogs. Name: Jersey  Breed: Poodle Mix  Approximate Age: 3 years Approximate Weight: 60 lb Currently Living at: high kill shelter in SC, Jersey will be arriving in the DC area soon to look for his forever family, Jersey now has adopters waiting for his arrival!   Jersey is a handsome 60 lb Poodle (mix?) who would love to come home for forever. Poodles are know to be super smart so Jersey will make you proud in an obedience class. His low shedding coat will need regular visits to the groomers to keep him looking handsome. This guy likes other dogs of his size but is NOT a fan of little dogs, so being an only child or having a larger canine sibling or two will be needed for him. We don't know how he is around kids but we can always ask if needed.   Jersey is a pretty big fellow and will need lovely long walks or runs every day to wear him out. If you think Jersey would be a perfect fit for your family please contact the adoption coordinator listed below. Like most shelter dogs, Jersey may need a refresher on housetraining. He is likely crate trained.  Jersey has tested positive and will be treated for Heartworm disease. Heartworm is not contagious to people or other pets, but results from mosquito bites. Heartworm, if left untreated, is life threatening, but after treatment, dogs that were heartworm positive should suffer no significant long-term effects so long as they are kept on a monthly heartworm preventative. The adoption fee for this dog is $450, which includes the cost of routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay/neuter and heart worm treatment.

Want to hang out? Eat some treats... watch some TV... take a leisurely walk? I love to lounge and your lap is about to be my favorite place. My name is Bobbin! I weigh about 57 pounds and I love to curl up on you lap even though I am kind of big. I am calm and affectionate so as long as I get a little exercise every day to stay healthy, I will be a pretty low-maintenance dog. I am a special boy who will need a family that knows to take it slow with me. I have lived with children before, but older children would be best for me. I have never lived with cats or dogs. I do seem to like smaller dogs who wont be rowdy with me best. Come visit me and it won't be long until we can lounge together!   Located in Adoption Dogs 39                
03/19/2016	Buck - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Salem, OR	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). I'm a good-natured dog who has a bundle of mental and physical energy, and I'm waiting for my chance to unleash it on the world. I have a clownish sense of humor, and I think everything is fun and meant for play, including you. Without adequate stimulation, I can become bored and destructive. Obedience or agility training could be helpful in channeling my need for physical and mental stimulation. I'd like to try some of the training classes they have here at the shelter. I also might make a good jogging or hiking partner. I usually like to be in the thick of things and definitely don't appreciate being left behind. Anything you do, I'll want to do too. I've been described as boisterous, lively, and playful; but I might be too rambunctious for small children. Older sturdier kids should be able to handle my size and play style. With my personal brand of surprises, life with me will keep you constantly on your toes, and the fun is guaranteed. If you love me, but can't adopt, please ask about sponsoring.

03/19/2016	Annie - Border Collie / Australian Shepherd / Mixed (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Border-Aussie	Baileyton, AL	Female	Posted Breed: Border Collie / Australian Shepherd / Mixed (long coat). Annie is a very sweet 14 month old Border Collie/Australian Shepherd mix. Before coming into rescue, Annie lived her life on a chain. She was passed from one elderly couple who could not handle such a young and energetic dog to another elderly couple in the same predicament. No wonder!! The poor girl was bored to death! Consequently, Annie was liberated from her chain and came into rescue where she got to run free in a large enclosed area and play with other dogs for the first time in her life. To say she is thrilled is an understatement. A forever home of her own with a young person or couple with the same energy level as hers, is Annie's dream and Fairy Dogmother is going to find it for her. Annie is spayed, fully vaccinated, heartworm negative and on monthly heartworm/flea preventive. She is a friendly and loving girl. She loves everybody, whether two legged or four legged. Annie's adoption fee is a tax deductible donation to the rescue in the amount of $450.

Hooch has settled in to his new foster home and is loving the care and attention he?s getting. Sadly, he is one more of so many dogs coming in to BRAF who were not given monthly heartworm preventative so he was not protected when bitten by an infected mosquito. Hooch will be undergoing heartworm treatment with weeks of being kept quiet, though he will be in good hands with his foster family. Please check back for updates on this sweet boy. 1/30/16ÿ? Hooch was not in a happy place until Jean from BRAF came and got him. Took him home bathed and fed him. Now he is a happy loving boy. This handsome big boy has some healing to do, but he is house trained, loveable and is just loving his human.

Una glows with happiness and love. Una is very chill with her people and other dogs, she adores her foster's kid. She is great on leash but currently receiving training in basic commands. She’s been meeting all kinds of new dogs and getting on well right away on morning hikes. She is not an off-leash dog and needs structure. Una’s dad just died and she needs some extra patience with decompression and readjustment. New guardian should be prepared to allow her a 30-day unpacking process for her to relax and fit in. Experienced dog guardian with a secure fenced yard (6ft) and not gone all the day will be optimal. Una would make the perfect office dog if you are allowed to take your dog to work. She smiles all the time and is playful and loving. Una doesn’t bark and she sleeps through the night peacefully. If you'd like to meet Una, please contact Amanda: (310) 699-2529 or mailto:ladogposse@ gmail.com  Note: This is a courtesy posting for our fellow rescuer, which means that even though this animal does not belong to our group, we are here to help those who need to find a home for their animals.

I am looking for a new home. They love me where I live now, but I am allergic to one of the exotic plants/fruits growing in the backyard and it makes me itch like crazy to go out there which means I have to stay in the house all the time except when I go on walks in the front. My owners love me bunches but know it is not fair to me to always have to be in the house when they are in the backyard. I am a great dog and very submissive around new dogs. I will cower and let them smell me and then I am ok and want to play with them.

Adopting A Shelter Dog These dogs come without background histories/ past medical information. We present these dogs as we have observed in relationship to age, size, breed, behavior, housebreaking, crate training, good with children, cats, dogs, and strangers. Dogs may present themselves differently in different environments, therefore The Dog Spot Rescue, their agents, volunteers, can not guarantee behavior, age, size expectations, breed, house Training, destructive behavior tendencies, and/or medical issues. All dogs from shelters have been subjected to pathogens from the shelter level which can materialize into disease in the future. Each adopter must observe for themselves pre-adoption and make decisions for themselves the suitability of said dog and their tolerance levels for transitional time when adopting a shelter dog. We ask that each adopter take their time when making the choice to bring home a rescued dog.Great ball dog! There's so many wonderful things I can relay to a new prospective family about Yogi. Great with kids, adults, and my small dogs (because they don't run and hide) Kids yelling, playing, jumping around does not bother him at all When people come to the door, he's curious but calm Knows how to sit and shake and working on lay down Understands no Walks well on leash Loving and friendly and loves belly rubs and kisses Crate trained Follows me from room to room Not food or toy aggressive Likes to be near his family when eating, otherwise doesn't eat much Defers to the toy poodle Extremely smart and trainable Did well for the groomer Likes to play ball and be chased Does not bark or scratch at the door and quietly lays on the steps outside until you bring him inThese are the attributes reported by Yogi's foster who also reports he will chase a running cat. She thinks he wants to play but cat wants no part of it. When tested with cats prior, he showed no interest at all. So we guess it depends on the cat or maybe better to have no cat at all. Yogi is a wonderful dog that we are proud to offer for adoption. If interested in meeting this great family dog prospect, please fill out an on line form at: thedogspot.rescuegroups.org and then e-mail us at: thedogspotrescue@aol.com for a meet and greet appointment this Saturday. Big paws crossed!Your Adoption Fee covers the following expenses: Spay/Neuter, DHLPP, Bordatella, Rabies (if age appropriate), De-worming and Frontline/Advantage Please Note: Shelter/rescue dogs have been exposed to many pathogens such as kennel cough, parasites, diseases and conditions some of which may not have been discovered prior to adoption. Any dog that shows symptoms here at TDS are routinely identified, taken for tests and treatment. Our vet bills can exceed $10,000 a month. However, without symptoms, we may miss a disease, or pre-existing condition or parasite. Consider carefully if you have the tolerance for these possibilities. We consider, you, the adopters, the last leg of the rescue process.

03/19/2016	MJ - German Shepherd Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Harrisville, WV	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (medium coat). MJ is 3 years old and weighs 80 lbs. His family feels it would be best for him to find a new home because they are super busy and feel they don't give him the time he deserves.  He has never had any training so he needs an experienced adopter. He is a bit mouthy so a home without small children would be best. He was just brought in 3/11/16 so we will test him with other dogs and cats once he gets settled. The first day is stressful! His adoption fee will be $150.  UPDATE: 3/15/16 - We have yet to test with other animals because he is still really anxious at the shelter. His family came last evening so I could observe how he interacts with them. He showed that he loves them and listens when talked to in a stern voice but he jumps on everyone and he is rough with his daddy who plays rough with him. He needs some obedience training and someone that understands the breed and their needs. He knows basic commands like sit and shake. We will not place him with a family with small children at this time. We don't believe he would purposely hurt a child but he is big and unruly. If interested in adopting a pet from our shelter please request an application by sending an email to rchumane@zoominternet.net. Email is the best way to get information on adoptable pets. The shelter staff is busy and not often able to answer phone calls. Thank you for your interest!

Please contact Trinity GAP Club (trinitygapclub@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Some pets are in the Shelter and others in Foster homes. Scroll thru description for contact info!! Or you may email trinitygapclub@gmail.com for pet info! Trinity GAP Rescue was contacted to help Millie find a new home. GAP has no open fosters so if someone can foster Millie, GAP will take her into their rescue. Finding her a home within 30 days is the main priority but fostering her is a close 2nd!   Update: Millie’s owner has to surrender Millie within 30 days due to her apartment rules. She cannot break her lease and has no money to move anywhere else and start over with Millie. She rescued Millie about 5 years ago from a local shelter and truly truly loves her but Millie has some dog aggression issues and she is totally banned from the apartments. Trinity GAP is trying to help Millie and has our resident dog trainer working with her. He thinks she is entirely “fixable”. She is great with people, and a very good looking girl. She will be pound bound at the end of 30 days if we can’t find her a home.   Hurst, TX - Millie is a 5 year old, 70 lb., Boxer mix. She is spayed, house broken, up to date on all her shots and heartworm negative. She is my dog but I have 30 days to find a home for her. She is very active and not good around kids. She's very reactive around other dogs. She will need an experienced dog handler. She does better with dogs who are submissive. Usually introduction to other dogs is very slow. I can take her to adoption events and do the home visits. I love her to pieces but I can no longer keep her due to apartment rules.  Please contact me at carolina.sortogp@gmail.com if interested in Millie!  Thank you, Carolina. To help ensure Millie’s safety, her adoption fee is $50 to be donated to Trinity GAP Rescue. If you’d like to foster Millie thru Trinity GAP, please contact trinitygapclub@gmail.comShelter Dogs: Fully Vetted Males are $100 and Fully Vetted Females are $125 (Fully Vetted means the dog has been spayed/neutered, vaccinated, including rabies shot, and heartworm tested) Dogs Not Vetted: Males are $60 and Females are $85 (You will be responsible for taking the dog to be spayed/neutered at Animal Hosp & Clinic of Arlington, within 30 days, and this adoption fee will include the spay/neuter, vaccinations, and rabies shot.

03/19/2016	Madrox - Doberman Pinscher / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Doberman Pinscher-Unknown Mix	Newton, KS	Male	Posted Breed: Doberman Pinscher / Mixed (short coat). Howdy everyone, my name is Madrox! I seem to warm up to people pretty fast, but it does seem to take me a little longer to warm up to men. So if you are a man, and I ignore you or even growl at you, you're going to take it slow with me. Start out by walking slowly up to my cage and talking softly to me, and the important thing to remember is to allow me to approach you when I'm ready. In fact, once I have gotten used to you, the best way for me to start warming up to you even more is by you giving me some affection. However, I don't like my neck to be touched or messed with. In fact, trying to get a collar and or leash on me can sometimes be challenging, because I become really head flippy and will try pulling away to avoid it all together.Though the people here at the shelter are working with me, by using treats to let me know it's okay to have a leash put on, so when I do find a home, I'm going to need to find someone who is willing to still work with me on it. I am still sort of a young dog, so as a result, I still have a lot of energy, and love when someone takes me outside where I can run around and play with toys such as ropes, stuffed toys, and squeaky toys. However, I do from time to time start playing a little too rough, so you'll have to let me know when I do. In my previous house, I lived as an outside dog only, so as a result, I am not housebroken. However, if you put in some time and training with me, hopefully I eventually can be. Speaking about training, I haven't had any, but the ladies in the office have worked with me on the command sit, and I am becoming better at it. So if you are willing to work with me on learning some of the other ones, I'm sure that with time I can learn them as well. In my previous house, I lived with a couple of other dogs and were friendly and playful with them, but when met a couple of dogs here at the shelter I was very unsure of them. So as you can tell, I need training in a lot of different areas, but if you are willing to put in some time and effort with me, I have a feeling in the end you won't regret it.

03/19/2016	Trooper - Black Labrador Retriever Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Westminster, MD	Female	Posted Breed: Black Labrador Retriever. All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.This wonderful lab, Trooper, has a very sad past. He was used for target practice with a BB gun! Then the owner abandoned the house and the dog. Another person took over caring for him and brought a few hounds along. It was not long before he got bored and he left also, feeding the dogs occasionally with the help of some kind neighbors. We finally were able to save Trooper and brought him to safety. Trooper had lived with a choke chain collar on which damaged his vocal cord a little. Therefore he will be adopted out with a NO PULL HARNESS and his new owner will be required to use this. Trooper has been with us since the end of November and has been wonderfully cared for and mentally and physically nourished. Fearful at first, he turned 360 degrees and slowly became more trusting toward humans. Trooper has a girl friend! See MILA's profile also listed on our site and their video. Trooper is 8 years old but you would never know it. He is happy and lively. Up to date on all shots, Heartworm neg. and on monthly preventionHe is on Nexgard for fleas, de-wormed and microchipped.Has a wonderful shiny coat. Is not at all food aggressiveTrooper's new family should be very active and have a fenced yard to run around. If you are interested in adopting Trooper, please contact:Marion at marionvhkober@gmail.com

03/19/2016	RAIDER - Pit Bull Terrier / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Labrador Retriever Mix	West Palm Beach, FL	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). I''m as rough and tough as a tank, but only in size. I''m a hefty 73 pounds, but most of my size is made up by my huge heart! I have a teddy bear that''s all mine and I take him for walks with me. He gets soggy though because I can only carry him in my mouth. I heard someone call me a `big baby.` I''m not really sure how I feel about that, but they were smiling when they said it so I guess it can''t be a bad thing. I try to be well-mannered, and I''ll always sit for a treat. I''m a bit of a messy eater though. With a big mouth like mine, it''s hard not to slobber at least a little bit. Toys are always fun. But sometimes I don''t want to give them back unless you trade me for something I like just as much. But that''s an easy fix. I''d trade any of my toys for a new home. Except maybe my teddy bear                
03/19/2016	SNOWY - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	West Palm Beach, FL	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat).

Hello! I''m Cruze! Gosh, I''m so happy to see you! You know, I''ll say it right now - I''m a total joy to be around. I love my people friends very, very much and I''m pretty happy hanging out with some dog pals too. Anyway, I''m basically one big, loving baby. I love cuddles very, very much, and I''ll probably want to crawl up into your lap so I can give you kisses and show you just how much I appreciate you! My tail almost never stops wagging. I''m not just a lovebug though, I also love to explore the outdoors. If there''s a bush to investigate, trust me, I''ll want to be right inside of it! My nose is almost always glued to the ground when I''m exploring, and I''m actually pretty great on a leash. I hope I sound like a good match for you! I''m so excited to find my forever home!

03/19/2016	Rodo - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Orange, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Rodo is a 3 year old, chocolate Lab mix dog. He's losing his home because his humans work too many long hours and it's a lonely life for poor Rodo. They have been coming home twice a week during lunches to walk him and want to find a home where he will be happier. He's full of life and love. He loves his people and to play. He loves his rope and gladly welcomes you into his play. Rodo loves walks, being part of the family, and affection. This poor boy has been through a bit of bouncing around in his short life. He bounced back and forth twice between the original owner and the current owner. Poor Rodo just needs his solid family to love him, have time for him, play with him, and to show him commitment. His current owners have done all they can to give him the best. The even put him through an expensive board and train program and now Rodo is a HIGHLY TRAINED DOG! Rodo KNOWS SIT, STAY COME, DOWN, GO TO YOUR PLACE (where he stays until given a command to release him). He's CRATE TRAINED AND LEASH TRAINED. He can walk at your side in a HEEL position. He hasn't taken his CANINE GOOD CITIZEN TEST yet, but it's likely he could pass with a little more practice. He's had socialization with LOTS OF DOGS and played off leash with these trained and balanced dogs. He's had many pack walks down a busy street with lots of people and their dogs and he's had to be a behaved boy. While Rodo is such a loving and good boy, he can tend to be shy initially of people and needs to feel safe. Rodo really needs a family who will continue to keep up with his training and socialization. The good thing about Rodo going through this training program is that the person who adopts him will be entitled to continue his dog group socials/play sessions. The adopter will also receive the expert help and any advice/training from the trainer, as well as be able to participate in the group pack walks with all the other dogs along with the trainers. Rodo can also be boarded by the trainer at a rate lower than most boarding facilities, and you have the reassurance that he is in capable hands. If you are interested in Rodo, please contact his owners Kevin and Sabrina directly at kevincdiaz@gmail.com, or  sabrinablando@gmail.com or by phone (858) 386-8686

03/19/2016	Rogue - Hound / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Fargo, ND	Female	Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed. {s3829code380/} If you would like to provide this dog a loving home, please fill out a pre-adoption application.     Have a question? Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.   Statistics    Name: Rogue Breed: Hound Mix Age: 2 Years Size: Large Adoption Donation: $180 (applicable sales tax included). Adoption fees may be paid with cash or check. Other: Spayed Female, vaccinations current, microchip       Rogue is a gorgeous girl who is dog, cat and child friendly!        Foster Home Feedback   3/16/16: Rogue is a beautiful 2 year old Coonhound-Setter mix. She is a big girl with long legs and weighs in at 71 pounds. She has been with us about two weeks and is a friend to all – even the cat. She is curious but submissive when meeting other dogs. She loves to play with our Lab/Pit mix, but would also be happy in a home as the only dog. She has only met teenagers but I suspect she would be great with kids of any age. Rogue’s strengths are many – she is fully potty trained, is extremely dog and kid friendly and really just a happy go lucky girl. She is pretty smart, too. We gave her a treat puzzle and she figured it out in record time. She is motivated by treats and would be fun to train. Even though she is young and athletic, she doesn’t require a lot of exercise to tire her out. A quick walk or some fetch in the back yard and she is usually lazy the rest of the day. Another plus is she is a great car rider. She hops in the back and sits perfectly. Anyone planning to adopt Rogue should be prepared for the many compliments she receives whenever she is out and about. She is a beautiful dog. She has brown freckles on her feet and lower legs, black freckles on her upper legs and body, and the cutest face with a mixture of freckles and those long hound dog ears. Rogue’s weakness are pretty minor – she is still young, so every time we come home, she gets pretty excited. Occasionally she will jump up on us. We are working with her on manners. As a coonhound mix, her nose is always going. She has stolen a few things off the counter when we weren’t looking. She is smart enough not to do this while we are near. We leave her unkenneled during the day (with only dog food and water accessible) and she has been a perfect little lady. We do crate her at night, mainly so she gets the signal it’s time to lie down and be quiet. The first few nights she barked a bit but she is quiet now and seems to get the routine. She is not a barker in general, but sometimes when we play she gets excited and will bark her awesome (but loud) coonhound bark. We correct her and she responds immediately. She likes to pull on the leash, but with modification, she walks nicely. Rouge would love to find her forever home. If you’re interested in a unique looking dog and a loyal companion, she’s your girl!To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org

03/19/2016	FURBIE - Chow Chow / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chow Chow-Unknown Mix	Sayreville, NJ, NJ	Male	Posted Breed: Chow Chow / Mixed. Fabulous Furbie was originally rescued from a hoarding situation in Philadelphia where he had been living in an overcrowded basement with several other dogs. Because of that neglect, he was extremely fearful and not ready for adoption after rescue. To help him overcome his fears, Furbie participated in the ASPCA’s Behavioral Rehabilitation Center program for fearful dogs where he began to learn that unfamiliar people, objects, sounds and real life situations aren’t all that scary. Furbie has graduated from that program with flying colors, and now he really wants to meet you!  Furbs can be shy at first, but once he warms up, he can't WAIT to show you all of the things he's learned! He loves to be scratched and petted, enjoys the company of other dogs, and is generally a fun and affectionate guy. He has a birth defect which causes his jaw to be a little crooked, but we think it makes him look like a loveable bear! Furbie is looking for an experienced, patient, adopter who can continue to help him learn new things and show him how great the world can be!

03/19/2016	Ruthy - Boxer Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Chicago, IL	Female	Posted Breed: Boxer. Meet Ruthy!Ruthy is one of the sweetest dogs we have ever had in our program! She is loving and gentle, and when you talk to her, her tail goes a million miles an hour! She was turned in with a litter of her 10 puppies after their owner could not provide proper care for them. She is a Boxer and has an adorable underbite, and has a long, natural tail. Because she was not socialized in her last home, she can be a bit reserved when meeting new people, but give her a few minutes, and she will be sitting in your lap. When Ruthy arrived in our program, she was in very poor condition- she had a severe mammary ulcer, mastitis (inflammation/infection of her mammary tissue) which caused a high fever, a skin infection, fleas, and was underweight. Because of her awful condition, and infection which was being spread to her babies through her milk, she was not able to nurse her babies. Thankfully, another recently nursing mother, Betsy, took on the babies and allowed them to nurse until they could eat on their own. Ruthy and her babies were immediately rushed to the nearest vet, as she was lethargic and in a lot of pain. She was put on antibiotics and pain medication, Nutro brand puppy food (to help gain weight), and started to feel better within a few days. She has recovered very nicely, and is now ready to find a home that will give her all the love and attention she deserves!Ruthy walks fairly well on a leash now (she had never been on a leash when she came into our program), but does still occassionally pull backward (not very hard, she just stops walking and leans back), but this can be corrected with encouraging her to walk forward and come to you. Her previous owner stated that she was house trained, but she has been having accidents in her kennel (6'x6' indoor kennel), and will need her new family to work with her on this. Having accidents in a shelter setting does not necessarily mean she is not house trained, as it may just be from stress from a home enviroment (even though it was not a great situation) to a shelter. She is up to date on all vaccinations and is being spayed on 3/11/16.IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE READ ALL INFORMATION BELOW! APPLY AT: www.DogsFromMars.net!Once approved, you will be able to schedule a meeting with an available animal for our upcoming adoption event!

Meet Diesel, an almost 7 year old black male who's full of LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. Diesel has anxiety and takes medications for it, which he takes like a CHAMP! He drinks plenty of water and loves food especially peanut butter and chicken. He will sit and let you pet and scratch him for hours if you're willing. This dog gives so much love and attention and all he asks is the same in return.    Diesel keeps himself busy with toys. He loves running around the yard, chasing squirrels or going for walks.  He is crate trained and house broken. No accidents here. When he hears's ""time for bed"" he runs right upstairs and jumps on the bed. He likes to take my spot and won't move until I give him a good ear scratching and then he settles down for the entire night.   Diesel would do best in a calm, quiet home - no kids, no other pets, maybe 1-2 adults to help reduce his anxiety. He's an awesome dog with a rough start to life and has come through it with flying colors. He's looking for his furever mate to give him the love and attention he so much deserves.

03/19/2016	Sky - German Shepherd Dog / Labrador Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog-Labrador Retriever Mix	San Diego, CA	Male	"Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog / Labrador Retriever / Mixed. Sky was adopted from the Riverside shelter at 2 months old, but 6 years later the owner's new step-child exhibited high allergies to him so he was returned to the shelter. This 78 pound gentle giant has all the qualities of a dog who's been around the block with multiple commands under his belt, great on a leash (with the occasional tug), and house trained. He is getting used to staying in his crate at night which is new for him. One of Sky's best qualities is that he doesn't let other dogs, doorbells, or other things excite him - he is calm, relaxed, playful, and loving. Morning and evening walks have become standard-issue exercise for Sky and he'd love to continue that regimen in his new home. Since being with TRD, Sky has obviously had some ""golden year"" aches and pains. We have him on a medication and low-impact exercise regimen, which he will need to continue with his forever family, and which seems to be working great for Sky. He eats twice a day and treats make his learning curve steep! Sky deserves to be placed back into a loving and true forever family. If you would like to meet Sky, please fill out an application on the TRD website and an adoption coordinator will be in touch to set up a meet and greet.http://therescueddog.org/available-dogs/dog-adoption-application/                "

FOSTER LOCATION: Meridian, ID   Diesel is one handsome fellow who is just as sweet as he is good looking. This boy is about 4 ½ years old and is already in need of a 3rd home through no fault of his own. Fuzzy Pawz wants to find him his last and forever home. We believe Diesel is a German Shepherd/Lab mix and is a good sized dog at 85 pounds.   This guy is a mild-mannered boy that can let his playful inner puppy come out when he has others to romp with but he also loves to have a quiet corner where he can relax and snooze the day away. Diesel will bark at strangers when they come to the house but will welcome strangers with open paws when told that they are friends. He has lived with small kids and does great with kids over 5 that know to be nice to dogs. He needs a home that is able to give him attention (but also have his quite downtime), take him for walks (he needs more training on not pulling on the leash), and even car rides (which he loves tremendously). He is friendly with all he meets out in public and just a nice well-rounded guy.   He is house - trained and prefers to stay indoors near his family, but loves to be outside exploring. He is well behaved, obedient, and eager to please, but can be timid in certain settings (like the vet). He knows a few basic commands (sit, stay, shake, here). He loves to play with other dogs, and does well with dogs of all sizes and ages, but would do best in a home without cats.  Diesel has had some seasonal skin allergies and so he does take Prednisone when needed. Side effects of this medicine are that he wants to eat and drink more, thus poops and pees more. He has become a little obsessed about food, since taking the medicine. He is not possessive (in fact a toddler can take food right out of his bowl without him flinching), but he will eat anything that he can and has been caught stealing what he knows he shouldn't. All of this can be remedy by either more training, making sure not to leave food out or possibly a change in medication during the spring.   Diesel make a great dog for most any household that wants a walk/run partner (he has to have daily exercise) but is also looking for a dog to lay at their feet at the end of a long day.   Diesel is neutered, vaccinated   If you feel you can offer this sweet boy the forever loving home she deserves, please complete an adoption application here: http://fuzzypawzrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application-2/   There is a $75 adoption fee for Diesel

The Helotes Humane Society is a non profit organization dedicated to placing unwanted animals in loving homes. Remember, don't shop, adopt!Chessa is a very sweet and loveable four year old 65 pound German Sheppard. She was brought to Helotes Humane Society after her owner became sick and is no longer able to care for her. Chessa is very much an indoor dog who likes to play with her toys and lounge around with her humans. She gets along well with other dogs but all play time should be supervised. Chessa is an active dog who will need regular exercise and will certainly benefit from a formal training class with her new owner. She is house trained, crate trained and still working on her leash manners. Like many pure breeds, Chessa is susceptible to allergies which causes discomfort in her ears. She will require routine ear cleaning and might even have to see a vet a little more regularly than most rescue animals. If you are interested in learning more about Chessa or meeting her please call Tanya Espalin at (210) 279-9159 or email at tanyaespalin@visitsanantonio.com . ThanksAll of our animals receive vaccinations, testing and altering appropriate for their age. All pets will be microchipped prior to placement. The pet overpopulation problem has reached a crisis stage. We will use all of our resources to spay and neuter all pets in our care.

Bowser is a 2 year old male mixed breed dog. He is very timid around new people, and his immediate reaction when frightened is to lay as flat on the floor as possible or hold tight to the leg of someone he knows and trusts. This poor boy was never given a lot of opportunity to socialize with new people or places as a puppy, which makes him a bit skittish. Once he knows you, Bowser would prefer nothing else than to stick right by your side, hold your leg, or crawl into your lap.

He doesn't seem to have been taught basic commands, but he is happy to learn. He's pretty much got 'come' and 'sit' down already. He is crate trained and hardly makes a peep at night. We kennel him during the day, only because we aren't sure he's house trained. We've got him learning how to ring a bell tied to our door when he needs to go potty and he's picking that up quickly. He really is such a sweet heart. ​He loves belly rubs and a good head massage. He genuinely seems eager to learn and please, it would be a breeze to teach him anything. We have two cat's and there hasn't been any issues, though they do not come out very much so it's hard to say for sure. Aries is truly a gem of a dog, and he's going to make someone very lucky!

All I need now is to find someone who will love me.   Please ask to meet with an adoption counselor, so we can be properly introduced and talk about what kind of pet you're looking for. We can discuss whether you're looking for a lap pet or a social butterfly, an ""only pet"" or a furry ""sibling"" for kids or other animals.   Best of all, by adopting from Animal Friends, you make it possible for them to rescue and care for another pet who truly needs help. So, what are you waiting for? Let's sit down together!  *****************************************************Luigi is a lovable handsome guy that was transferred from another shelter. He is a wonderful dog that enjoys riding in the car and is not bashful to jump right in. Luigi is energetic and when he gets to know you, loves to show his affection (trying to crawl on your lap to lick your face!). Luigi really enjoys going for walks but is a strong puller on leash and could benefit from some loose-leash training. He will fit right in with an energetic family with children 8 years and older with no other animals. Luigi just want to be the center of attention!*****************************************************  To learn more about Animal Friends or view adoptable dogs, cats and rabbits, visit www.ThinkingOutsideTheCage.org.

03/19/2016	MARLEY - American Bulldog / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Bulldog-Unknown Mix	West Palm Beach, FL	Male	Posted Breed: American Bulldog / Mixed (medium coat). Dogs need several things to be happy, such as being kept inside where they can be part of the family, regular vet care, toys, nutritious food, clean water, obedience class, socialization with people and pets, and most importantly, lots of love and attention! They need regular grooming and baths and heartworm prevention medicine every month for their entire lives. Depending on the breed, dogs can live to 20 years of age. We ask that you consider carefully that you can make a lifetime commitment to this pet.                
03/19/2016	Jeff - American Bulldog (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Bulldog	The Woodlands, TX	Male	"Posted Breed: American Bulldog (short coat). Please contact Sparr for more information about this pet.Jeff wants to be loved. He adores attention and will ""talk"" to anybody he sees trying to encourage them to come love on him. This boy just loves to eat, and run, and shove his way in for pets and loving. His need for attention leads to Jeff being just a bit rambunctious at times so he's not recommended for small children or the infirm. At least not without some training to help him understand he's a big boy and a little goes a long way. Jeff would probably do well with a companion dog with a proper introduction. He hasn't been around cats or small critters so those would be a ""check on introduction"".                "

Sunnie is a petite 2 year old lab/golden mix. She is sweet as sugar and really loves being brushed and petted. She will roll over and almost go into a trance when being brushed. Her favorite thing is being petted, and would be happy if you would do that all day. Sunnie is a Velcro girl and will follow you around from room to room. She is shy and takes time to get used to her new surroundings. She is going to need love and patience to trust her new family. She does alert bark at people and noises in the house (doors closing, people talking, unusual noises) but stops once she knows all is well. She enjoys her walks and is pretty good on a leash. She has moderate energy and enjoys running around, although she does tire out after a couple miles of walking. She is housebroken, and has pretty good house manners.other than a little counter surfing which her foster parents are working on correcting. She gets along with her foster Golden brother, but they have not engaged in play yet. She has recently discovered that toys are super fun, and she has a toy in her mouth all the time. She loves the harder toys to chew on like Nylabones. Sunnie would benefit by an obedience class or two with her forever family. She is smart, eager to please, and a quick learner. Sunnie has huge potential and we are looking for an adopter who will give her all the love, guidance, and exercise she needs to thrive.

03/19/2016	Forrest - Staffordshire Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Staffordshire Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Dallas, TX	Male	Posted Breed: Staffordshire Bull Terrier / Mixed. Resilient. Gentle. Forgiving. These are all words that describe Forrest, a three ­year ­old black mouth cur mix. Forrest was found stuck in a creek when he was spotted by a concerned citizen. He was injured so he couldn’t get out on his own. Fortunately, a Dallas Animal Services officer climbed in and got him out! Once he was taken to the shelter, it was discovered that he had fractures that seemed weeks old and had to have a toe amputated. After sitting at DAS for months, he was rescued by Dallas Pets Alive! and has since been recovering in a loving foster home.          Despite his rough start, Forrest’s gentle spirit has not been broken. He still loves people! Forrest loves to be close to his foster parents and enjoys ear scratches and the occasional belly rub. Despite his injury, he gets around just fine and enjoys playing in the backyard. Forrest is a very mellow and quiet dog. While he enjoys playing with his rope toys and bones, his favorite thing to do is lounge around the house. One of the best things about Forrest is the way just one ear perks up when he is intrigued. Somewhere along the way, Forrest’s tail was docked but he wiggles his little nub in the cutest way when he’s excited.          Forrest is housebroken and, with a little coaxing and some toys, does well in a crate. He would probably be fine as an only pet but gets along well with other dogs. He is gentle with kids but would probably prefer a home with older children. His perfect family will be calm and caring, just like him!            Forrest is so worthy of a second chance at a long, happy life with a family who will give him all the love he deserves. Forrest is smart, sweet, loving and ready for his forever home!      All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months is $200, and puppies under six months is $250, unless specified otherwise.

Please contact Amy (aloggins.ppnk@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Application is required - Please go to www.ppnk.orgAdoption Fee $200Carson is a 4 year old friendly male Rottweiler. He is neutered, microchipped, and very eager to meet his new family!   Carson ended up at animal control because his owner dumped him and no longer wanted him. I can't understand why, because he knows a few commands, is quiet, crate trained, and appears to be house trained. He is very underweight and weighs 58 pounds upon intake.   We are working on getting some weight put on him and continuing to show him that not all people are bad. He is shy, but very gentle and really loves to sit for treats and be pet. He is good on a leash and will do well with his new family. All our animals receive professional veterinary attention including spay/neuter, testing, vaccination, deworming, food and shelter.

03/19/2016	Nene and Gorda - Golden Retriever (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Retriever	Los Angeles, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Golden Retriever (medium coat). Nene (male, 6 years) and Gorda (female, 4 years) are owner surrenders and a couple of the sweetest goldens you will ever meet. They have been together since Gorda was a puppy. They have been absolutely perfect in their foster home, both housebroken with excellent indoor manners. Currently Nene and Gorda enjoy walks along the bay once or twice a day. They ride well in the car and will try to get into any vehicle with an open door thinking they are off for another adventure. Both have excellent leash manners and would probably do very well on a splitter. They have visited the beach once and were not interested in going into the water, they are more spectators of water sports. Nene and Gorda will play outside together a bit then just hang out…we would say couch potato style but they do not get on the furniture, only their beds. Both love to be with their people but have each other when need to be alone. They have exhibited no destructive tendencies inside or out. A bit about Nene…He is a big framed golden, big head, big feet, and a big heart! He loves body rubs from head to tail and will meander through your legs for more love. Overall he is gentle but sometimes is not aware of how much space he takes up so could knock small children over. Nene is bilingual and knows many commands in Spanish, so far we have ‘sit’ mastered in English. He loves his teddy bear and will romp and play in short spurts, then it is nap time. A bit about Gorda…She is the biggest sweetheart ever. She loves to cuddle and leans in for her hugs. She just can’t seem to get enough. Although smaller than Nene by far, she is still the boss of him. Nene and Gorda have been fine with other dogs they have met on walks but are the only two dogs residing in their foster home. While they would probably be okay with another dog in the home, their relationship is excusive. Cats on the other hand, no bueno. They need to be in a feline free home, no exceptions. If you have room in your heart for two lovable golden beauties, contact cisco.7587@yahoo.com. A home visit must have been completed before you will be considered as the lucky lottery winner for these two! cisco.7587@yahoo.com  If you have already had a home interview and are interested in meeting, please email at cisco.7587@yahoo.com .

03/19/2016	Guinevere - Golden Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Retriever-Unknown Mix	Los Angeles, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Golden Retriever / Mixed (medium coat). Age: 3 years...Lovely Guinevere arrived from Turkey on Valentine’s Day. Lovingly known as Winnie (as Guinevere is a mouthful when calling her), she is learning what love really is, and the comfort of knowing where her next meal is coming from. This red-headed beauty has a few battle scars on her face. A mix, we speculate she is part Australian Shepherd because of her build, tail, and the fact she is wicked smart! Winnie is housebroken, good with children and other dogs in the home. Many things are new to her since she has come to the US. She probably has never walked on leash before. She pulls and is all over the place, is baffled by joggers, and dogs on leash. Everything is new to her so it really depends on the situation if she will bark and investigate, or ignore. In new places and situations she is curious but sticks pretty close. Other times she may bark at a passerby. Winnie has discovered the comfort of a cozy bed at night, cuddling with foster mom. She loves belly rubs too and seeks her time in the spotlight for pets from dad. She is not really a fan of baths although she will be patient, and is happy when they are over; she has probably had only a handful in her life. Winnie does not have that typical Velcro golden nature. She is inquisitive and independent. Did we mention smart? She has learned how to open the screen door. Not a runner, she is not going to wander too far from a home she knows will provide love and a steady meal. Although she does not understand English, she will be easy to train because she is so food motivated and smart. She now sits patiently and waits for her meals and treats. Winnie is being fostered with a couple other goldens and shepherd mix, all older/seniors. They get along well although they do not play. We do not know if she is in a home with another playful golden if she will be a good playmate, she seems disinterested. She hasn’t quite figured that out yet. She takes solace in their companionship during the day when her foster family is away at work but could probably also be fine as an only dog. This girl has been on her own for a while. While she has not been destructive out of boredom, she has dug a couple holes in the yard looking for gophers. She also has more than a keen interest in cats so she needs to be in a feline free home, no exceptions. She will probably chase rabbits, squirrels, and anything else that used to be a meal. Winnie loves her people and will make a fabulous addition to a patient, loving family. If she is truly the blend we believe, given her age she will need a lot of activity ~ a great hiking or jogging partner. Being she is young, athletic, agile, and smart, Winnie is a great candidate for agility training if someone had the interest. Now you know what we do about this special girl. If you believe you are the family for Winnie, contact cisco.7587@yahoo.com. Please know that all interested families must have their home check completed. cisco.7587@yahoo.com  If you have already had a home interview and are interested in meeting, please email at cisco.7587@yahoo.com .

Gorgeous, Cattle dog /Shepard mix. Big guy, 75 at least. Not real tall, not over weight by any means, he's perfect!Moby is SO nice with other dogs and all people. Moby is simply a gentle giant!He didn't even think about jumping on me when I got him, but after a few days of being sweet to him, he thought it must be ok to jump on people... nope. A guy this size, not ok!I think Murphy taught him this actually, cuz they are having a fest! They don't challenge each other with this posture, Murphy starts is and Moby goes along. No scuffling here. Great play scenes though. Moby LOVES to play.He's eating from several feeders so I can see, zero resource guarding and he's nothing but nice to the other pack members of all ages and gender.It got rainy and muddy shortly after getting him home, so not a ton of photos yet. And during this photo shoot, he would come to me when I made a noise to get his attention, a little difficult in the back yard with no help, to take photos of Moby.But I loved watching him have fun, out of a kennel run and whooping it up with dogs in the yard.The rest of the pack loves him.Moby is not barker, and no digging or any unwanted behavior from him. So... what is his story?? He's not talking... One thing is clear, he is indeed a CCHD Rescue kinda dog. Moby has a place here until his person finds him. He deserves the best home!

All dogs from shelters have been subjected to pathogens from the shelter level which can materialize into disease in the future.

03/19/2016	Journey - Boxer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Lake Ann, MI	Female	Posted Breed: Boxer (short coat). Journey came to us from a shelter. Prior to us bringing her into our group, she was bounced FIVE times, all five times where to NO FAULT of her own. Every one, the owners simply did not have the resources or the time to keep Journey; it was the owners were moving and couldn't take her with them, or they simply did not have the money to keep her. Finally, the shelter called us asking us to find her a FOREVER home, to which we gladly said YES !!.  Journey is 5 and 1/2 years old. Her foster mom says she is an absolute DOLL FACE and is VERY well behaved. She loves a good belly rub and enjoys chewing on her bone. She plays well with other dogs (no cats please), is crate trained, house broken, and very well mannered. Her foster mom has had ZERO ISSUES with her since being in her care. We are very happy that the effects of Journey being bounced around has NOT taken a toll on her mentality, as this girl is pure pleasure to have around. She is a very easy going, easy girl to love. All she needs now is somebody to give her a FOREVER home where she can finally rest her head on your lap for good.  Journey is spayed, current on all vaccines, heart worm negative, free of any internal/external parasites and is microchipped. Her adoption fee is $200 and for $200 you get a happy, very healthy girl, that is super easy to take care of.

COURTESY POST   Apollo is a pitbull, he's almost 5 years old. He's great with kids of all ages, plays well with other dogs, and loves to cuddle. I've never seen him around a cat so I'm not sure how he would react. He loves playing in the water and going for walks. Apollo loves to go for walks, play in the water, and to play with his toys. My favorite memory of Apollo was when the first time I took him to the lake. At first he was apprehensive, but then he dove right in and starred swimming around the lake playing chase with his brother. He had the biggest, cutest smile on his face. I want him and his brother (Sultan) to have a good home (preferably together) with a great family to love and play with. Apollo comes with some toys and a leash and harness. I'm asking for a $50 re-homing fee.   Apollo is available for adoption via a private citizen. You may contact Shelter Animals Advocates if you are interested in Apollo and/or Sultan and we will forward your information to the private citizen.

Hi!  Thanks for giving me some attention! I'd like you to know that I've already been spayed or neutered. At Animal Friends, dogs and cats also leave fully up-to-date on shots and microchipped. All I need now is to find someone who will love me.   Please ask to meet with an adoption counselor, so we can be properly introduced and talk about what kind of pet you're looking for. We can discuss whether you're looking for a lap pet or a social butterfly, an ""only pet"" or a furry ""sibling"" for kids or other animals.   Best of all, by adopting from Animal Friends, you make it possible for them to rescue and care for another pet who truly needs help. So, what are you waiting for? Let's sit down together!  *****************************************************This sweet boy has had a rough start but is on the up and up! He came from a shelter in West Virginia, where he came down with Parvovirus and was very sick for a while. Thankfully he made a full recovery and was able to be transported to Animal Friends in February. Tuggs has some skin and digestive sensitivity, but these both are well managed with some medicine and a special diet! He is a shy and timid dog, but once he warms up to you he is an absolute love bug. Tuggs has been through a lot, and definitely deserves a loving home. Because of his initial shyness, he would do best in a home with children at least 12 years of age. Stop by Animal Friends today to see if Tuggs is the one for you!*****************************************************  To learn more about Animal Friends or view adoptable dogs, cats and rabbits, visit www.ThinkingOutsideTheCage.org.

Buttercup is really not the wild and crazy girl she appears to be in her face picture. She does have very striking eyes that are more pronounced because of the tan markings around them. She has a a coat that is primarily white, a good lean build, weighing a trim 56 pounds. She takes treats nicely, enjoys some back scratching and chin and ear rubs. Her leash walking skills need some help, but with more practice she will catch on to that. In her kennel she has a lot to say, and it seems to translate to &quot;come see me!&quot; Lollypop Farm suggests that children in the home be at least 14 years old. Buttercup was found as a stray, so we have no history on her. She also would be happiest if she could be the only dog in your home. She and her new owner will be required to attend training classes. Buttercup needs to learn impulse control, and basic dog skills. There is a discount on the first six week session if the classes are taken through Lollypop Farm.

Tigger is playful and loves to play w/ other dogs but has shown he will guard toys from other dogs. Any playtime with other dogs should then be supervised and any toy should be removed from the play area. Tigger is great w/ children, too! He would love the company of children who would run around w/ him and throw balls and play chase. Tigger is house trained so no worries there! Tigger is active and would benefit from daily exercise, activity, playtime and even training to teach him new things. I’m sure he would love learning new things! You know when you keep the mind active, the body enjoys the benefits! Tigger pulls hard when on a leash so you can look forward to bonding time when you practice, practice practice walking together around the neighborhood. Maybe you need to tire him out first before the walking leash training? Well, let's look at it from a different perspective. Are you looking for a running partner? Hmmm, Tigger might fit right into your pace and once again the benefits of a tired dog are endless. Then it might be time to leash train for a walk! Tigger is waiting in the back so if you would like to visit w/ him, please visit the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 S Birdneck Rd, Virginia Beach, VA. Ask for him by name and/or ID number which is 1602-1626.  Virginia Beach Animal Care & Adoption Center has wonderful pets available for adoption.

03/19/2016	Mac - German Shepherd Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Millburn, NJ	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (medium coat). Meet Mac, a German Shepherd with soulful eyes and a hope to find a good home.  Big Mac found himself on the streets of Elizabeth before coming into the Sedona program. Mac is about 6 years old and a medium sized dog. He has a bit of chow mix in him, but is mostly German Shepherd. Mac likes to run and play fetch.  Put him in fenced in yard and he will burn off energy just tossing a ball or toy around himself, but will be even happier with a human companion to play with. Mac is also interested in meeting new dog friends. Mac knows his basic commands and he will sit and wait patiently for a treat or chance to play. He has some experience on a leash, but could use some additional leash training. Mac will bond very quickly to any new owner.  He can startle quickly and may exhibit some fear aggression.  Mac will do best in a household with an experienced dog owner and no small children. Although we don't require a fenced in a yard, it would be preferable for any owner to have a good sized property for Mac to play in.  We do require that Mac's adopter agree to training session with an approved trainer. Sedona Shepherd Sanctuary's mission is to rescue adult and senior German Shepherd and Shepherd mixes and find them loving homes. All of our dogs are fully vetted and up to date on all their shots Our adoption area includes New Jersey, Delaware Valley, Manhattan, Southern New York and Eastern Pennsylvania. We may adopt to Connecticut depending on circumstances. Please visit our website at www.sedonashepherd.com. Sedona

03/19/2016	Bud -  Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Pacolet, SC	Male	"Posted Breed: . Thank you for your interest in a rescued dog. Our descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.  We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.  Are you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.  Just browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.  thanks the CPR Adoption team  Date into Rescue: 3/4/16 Reason for being in rescue: Anderson county found as stray Foster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC Special Needs? none Weight: 50.5 lb Height: est 20"" at shoulder Adoption Fee: $200 Fence needed? Yes - I am active! What kind of home would be best for me? Bud would thrive best in a home that is active with their pets. He is curious and loves to explore and try new things! He would do well with another dog in his home. What is my personality like?  Bud is a friendly, goofy and loving boy. He is affectionate and playful, and loves to romp out in the fields on a nice sunny day. He is crate trained but much prefers to be out of the crate and interactive with people and other animals. We have discovered that he can climb a fence, and only does so to try and get to humans. He doesn't like to be left alone for too long outside. He respects the fence when he is being watched. How I act when I first meet new people:  House trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule. My age: 11 months Please note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. To apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application. Please note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home.  You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you. You can also read our adoption tips page for hints and helps on adopting a rescued dog. http://www.carolinapoodlerescue.org/AdoptionTips.shtml or for general information on Carolina Poodle Rescue, please visit our FAQs - http://www.carolinapoodlerescue.org/FAQGeneral.shtml                "

Have a question? Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.   Statistics    Name: Sitka Breed: Red Heeler - German Shepherd Mix Age: 1 Year Size: Large Adoption Donation: $180 (applicable sales tax included). Adoption fees may be paid with cash or check. Other:  Spayed Female, vaccinations current, microchip       Sitka would love to be your ""Happy Go Lu cky"" girl!       Foster Home Feedback   3/11/16:  Sitka is a very loving dog once she gets to know you. She can be a bit hesitant around new people at first, and will usually approach them cautiously with head down and tail tucked under. Once she feels comfortable with them, she will happily try and jump on them to be petted, however. It took Sitka a few days to get comfortable with the steps in our house. She was very cautious going up and down them and wouldn't go down the flight to the basement at all for a few days. Now she has no problem running up and down them. She is mostly potty trained, but when we didn't pick up on her cues right away, she was happy to do her business in the basement once she was comfortable going down there. Sitka gets along well with our other two dogs and is constantly trying to get them to play. They tend to ignore her a lot, but she is good about not pushing herself on them. Sitka needs to be watched carefully around food. She is not shy at all about jumping on the kitchen table if you food unattended. A firm ""No"" will quickly get her down, though. She usually will not try and grab food from the table if you are sitting there, though.  She has also tried to grab a computer mouse off of the table a couple times and got hold of a shoe that was not on our shoe rack, so she requires a bit of supervision until she learns what is and is not acceptable to chew on. Sitka handles the kennel reasonably well. She needs a bit of coaxing to go into it, but once there will usually settle down in it quickly.

WE CANNOT RESPOND TO GENERAL INQUIRES ABOUT A DOG WITHOUT AN APPLICATION ON FILE.   Cal is the best kept secret!!!! So shhhhh don’t tell your friends because we only have one Cal! What can we say? Cal is just pure happiness and love. All this pup wants is to cuddle up and give some kisses. He is such a happy guy who loves everyone he meets, including dogs and kids. Cal is fun and full of personality but he's not super-hyper. In fact, he's pretty mellow unless we are playing with him. Cal is house trained and doesn't chew or destroy anything. He rarely barks and not much bothers him. What more can you ask for? We believe him to be around 3 years old. He weighs 50lbs. Breed? Well, maybe some Dalmation, maybe some Springer Spaniel, maybe some Pointer. Whatever the mix, it spells perfection! Cal is a three year old, neutered, healthy boy. Somehow he found himself as a stray and was taken to Animal Control in GA. The day we saved him he was scheduled to be euthanized. Shew! That was too close. We don’t know why someone wasn’t looking for him, but their loss is our gain and can be yours too!! Cal is currently being fostered in New Jersey and would do well in a house either with or without other dogs. He is going to made a wonderful pet. He's a real catch!Adoption Application http://www.thelastresortrescue.com/adoptionapplication.htm

This sweet boy literally was going to be walked from the drop off to the back room, but one volunteer couldn't stand by and watch, so she texted us and we had minutes to respond. We are so glad we did because his ""accidents"" were caused by crystals in his bladder and are easily treatable with a consistent dose of the inexpensive medication, dl methionine, and will cost $16 a month. This seven year old boy is everything a good German Shepherd should be: loyal, active, vocal, smart and sweet! Don't let his age fool you, he loves toys and still has a happy life ahead of him. He absolutely will chase cats, but is great with other large/medium size dogs and would do great with children.

03/19/2016	Romeo - Golden Retriever (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Retriever	Los Angeles, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Golden Retriever (medium coat). Age: 5 years...Romeo is a very fitting name for this sweet golden retriever who arrived in America from Turkey on Valentine’s Day. Hard to believe this loving dog was tagged in his ear like cattle. We don’t know his background, but we do see that he is still a bit leery of new people & lacks the experience of any dog play time interaction. He has been in the company of other dogs, but has no desire to meet or play with them. Romeo is housetrained and has been left alone for several hours. He doesn’t chew anything or dig in the yard. His fosters are home most of the time so Romeo is used to having company. He sleeps through the night in his big soft bed. He will go in a crate but really doesn’t need it. Romeo’s foster Mom has been teaching him good table manners & he now understands basic commands of sit, come & stay especially when accompanied with hand signals. If encouraged with a treat, he will give you a handshake. Romeo is a quick learner but will need someone with patience, a gentle touch & time to continue his obedience training & slowly introduce him to other dogs. Cats unknown- although he does seem to have a ‘prey instinct.’ Romeo is a great walker, doesn’t pull on his leash. If unsure of his surroundings he proceeds with caution sometimes. He enjoys & looks forward to his twice a day walks. He likes a quick pace but will slow down when needs to. The walks do release his energy & he will nap afterwards. Romeo is not an active dog. He naps most of the day in his bed or on the cool floor. Although he may follow you room to room he is not a Velcro dog, he just likes to know where you are. He doesn’t really know what to do with a tennis ball, so don’t expect him to fetch. He likes to munch on his antler bone & braided rope toy. His favorite toy is the Kong and trying to get the treat out. Romeo enjoys sitting outside on the patio with his Fosters taking in all new sights and sounds. There is a pool & although Romeo has not shown any interest in the water, he has not been left alone outside. He will bark or give a “ruff” when he sees another dog outside the fence, to seemingly announce his presence. Romeo is a bit of an alert watch dog & will bark to let you know someone is coming. Most of all, Romeo loves to be loved! He is tentative when meeting new people & dogs, but once he feels you are safe, he loves your attention. He will come to you and put his head on your lap and snuggle with you on the floor hoping for a tummy rub. However he’s very sensitive to being touched near his tail or hugged too quickly by a stranger & can get spooked. We think he would be best in a mellow atmosphere as an only dog without kids or cats. The best way to describe Romeo is a very sweet loving dog. Please note that Romeo is one of the 10 dogs we rescued from Turkey. Therefore, Romeo’s adoption will be a minimum of $600.00 If you have completed BOTH your application & In Home Interview and feel that you would like to continue his training & work with Romeo so he can feel safe & secure in his forever home, Please contact GoldensRJoy@cox.net  If you have already had a home interview and are interested in meeting, please email at GoldensRJoy@cox.net .

03/19/2016	Molly - Saint Bernard (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Saint Bernard	Wheaton, IL	Female	Posted Breed: Saint Bernard (long coat). We welcome specific questions. Due to high volume of applications, we may not be able to respond immediately. Your patience is appreciated.  If an animal is on our website, it is still available but might have other applicants. If you find yourself interested in one of our animals, it is in your best interest to submit an application immediately. Submitting an application does not commit you to any animal, but does get you a head start with the adoption approval process.  We do not schedule meetings until you have an approved application As an all-volunteer, foster home based organization, ARF does not have a facility where applicants can visit our animals. The majority of our dogs and cats are brought to adoption events by our volunteers. We invite everyone to come to our events, but we must give priority to pre-approved applicants. Molly is a 4 year old female Saint Bernard who weighs in at 91 pounds. She is a wonderful, mellow, super sweet girl! Molly is housebroken and does great with free roam of the house. She does not care to be crated, and doesn't need to be. Molly enjoys playing outside in the yard. Inside she is all about loving, hugging, and cuddling! Molly would do best being the only dog in the house. She is fine with cats and loves kids.  Molly is micro-chipped, up to date on all vaccinations, housebroken and spayed. Her new family will be required to complete a basic obedience course of their choosing. Molly's adoption fee is $300. A meeting will not be scheduled until you have an approved application, so if you're interested in adopting Molly fill out an online application today! http://arf-il.org/application.html Once your application has been approved, an ARF volunteer will contact you to arrange a meeting.  If you’re invited to meet an animal, plan to arrive on time or early, as we cannot hold animals.  All household members must be present at time of adoption, including dogs.  We appreciate your cooperation.   Upcoming Adoption Events                
03/19/2016	Godiva - Golden Retriever (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Retriever	Los Angeles, CA	Female	Posted Breed: Golden Retriever (medium coat). Hello, my name is Godiva. I am an original Turkey dog who is 2 years old. I ran away from a shelter in Turkey because it was not a nice place to be. I, along with a few other friends, were so lucky that SCGRR took their time, money and efforts to send us over here to the United States so that we may be able to have the life that we are so deserving of. We flew in on Valentine’s Day to the open arms of so many volunteers! We were all so excited and scared. The next day, after having a slumber party together, and a much needed rest at a vet, we were off to our new foster families. I am so lucky to be at a home that allows me to run, play, eat normal meals and to just be loved. I keep hearing that I am the sweetest, most loving little girl. My true personality is showing more every day. They found out I am very vocal and love to speak my mind sometimes, so, I guess that means I can be a barker, especially when I see my foster sister/cat walking around upstairs, as we are kept separate, thankfully! I think I may be a little rough playing with her. I also like to bark at people and four-legged creatures walking in front of my foster house. I adore running around and playing outside and my favorite thing in the world are walks. I don’t enjoy car rides yet, but once in the car, I do just fine, and I am a runner, and not in the athletic way…I would bolt if given the chance! You need to be very careful with me. I am just so inquisitive, I get so excited to see birds, rabbits, lizards or anything that peaks my interest. After all, I am just a little girl and everything is so new and different to me. I’m starting to understand the language, but I definitely understand the love that I am getting and I adore it. I also love cuddles! Sometimes I think I’m a lapdog and enjoy climbing in your lap to be loved on. I am housetrained and will lay by the door if I need to go potty. I have learned how to sit, but need a little work with other commands. I also love to eat, which is good, since I am a little skinny! I was shaved in Turkey, possibly because of fleas and matted hair, so my beautiful hair is starting to grow back. If you think that I would fit in well with your family, which is possibly a house without other pets, as I get very excited and I am unsure how I would fit in. No small children, as I get so excited and don’t know when to stop playing sometimes. I’d also love an active family, since I have so much energy, and I need to have a secure yard, as I am so interested in the world and still have the urge to escape Also, be sure you have had your in home interview. Please contact my foster/rep mommy, Kris at lifeissweetwithagolden@gmail.com  If you have already had a home interview and are interested in meeting, please email at lifeissweetwithagolden@gmail.com .

03/19/2016	Tristan - Saint Bernard / Collie / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Collie-Saint Bernard Mix	Kennesaw, GA	Male	Posted Breed: Saint Bernard / Collie / Mixed. A GENTLE & FUN GUY: 4 years old / 67 lbs. I've quickly become a volunteer favorite around the Mostly Mutts shelter as I'm just a real sweetheart of a dog! I'm loving and gentle, walk well on a leash, seem good with other dogs, although I haven't had a chance to play with any yet, and I just love people! I'll lean into you for some attention and roll over for some tummy rubs. I do have a little bit of a shoe interest when I'm playful, so shouldn't live with someone who is already at risk of falling. I wouldn't want to accidently cause someone to get hurt by trying to play with their feet. I keep my room clean at the shelter, so hopefully that will translate to house trained in a home, but we're not sure yet. I'm pretty big, so I don't really care for crates. I've met a young child who comes to help her mom to visit the dogs and I was very gentle with her and in tune to her feelings which was adorable to watch. She was a little intimidated by my size so I approached her bowing my head as if to make myself smaller and then plopped on my back showing my tummy. I'm a super sweetie! Best no toddlers though that I may bump over while playing, etc. Sadly, I wasn't kept on Heart Worm prevention, so I'm HW positive. The good news is that I'll be treated for that in a few months and Mostly Mutts will cover the cost of that treatment with one of their vets. I hope to be with my family before treatment starts! Energy level: 4 – 6. I'm current on vaccinations, neutered and my adoption fee is $195.00. You can meet me Saturdays from 11:00 – 4pm at the Barrett Parkway PetSmart, 860 Cobb Place Blvd.

03/19/2016	CHICA - German Shepherd Dog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Waco, TX	Female	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (medium coat). Oh what an interesting story the life of a shelter dog would be! If only Chica could tell us the places she''s been and the things she''s seen, what a book! Maybe we would be able to understand better when she''s so afraid to be alone, why her anxiety makes her destructive to her surroundings. It''s easier to be accepting of strange behavior when we know the cause, but we can''t always know, can we? Maybe she''s been abandoned so many times she''s just never had a chance to figure out that somebody will keep coming back, no matter how many times they go to the store, or to work, or out to eat. Patience is always the key with a broken spirit - and brokeness can manifest itself in so many ways. When you''re with her, you''d never know she''s been walked out on so many times before! This girl can promise you unconditional love. Can you do the same?

Hi, I&#39;m Monkey! Much like my name suggest I like to play around. I have a rough and rowdy play style, but I am very smart and treat motivated. I already know the commands sit, down, and come. I love to play fetch, and play with toys! I have a moderate energy level and would benefit from a family that keeps my mind going and teaching me new tricks. Monkey&#39;s adoption fee includes neuter, all age-appropriate vaccinations, microchip, and 30 days of pet insurance. Come meet Monkey at the Adoption Center inside Petco: 11620 West 95th Street, Overland Park, KS 66214. He will be so happy to see you, and would be overjoyed to join your family!

03/19/2016	Dobbins - Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Phoenix, AZ	Male	"Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Dobbins - Pit-bull mix - 2 yrs old - Male This adorable boy was found wandering alongside an interstate up north… the area was deserted so we believe his owner drove him there and dumped him! Poor Dobbins waiting for his owner to come back and take him home, something that never happened. Someone driving by saw him just sitting there and called Animal Control. At the shelter Dobbins waited again, still nothing. When the shelter became over-crowded and Dobbin's life was at stake, the woman that runs it called Stealing Hearts, she knows the Director has a thing for ""bully breeds"". Well of course we couldn't let anything happen to this big-headed boy so we swooped him up. Dobbins is in the boarding facility that we use until a foster home opens but he's having a great time. He has a buddy-foster who takes him for walks every day and spends some time with him so he knows ""someone will always come back""! Dobbins is very playful, LOVES people and totally enjoys car rides. We are not 100% sure he's housebroken because he's not yet in a home, but the staff where he's boarded tell us he never has accidents in his kennel area. Dobbins is goofy, loving and will use his big head to ""push"" his way into your heart. He has a lot of energy so we'd like his new family to be active people but after a good hike, Dobbins would love to snuggle up next to his person and take a good nap. Our handsome boy SNORES, snorts and makes all the adorable noises a family can't live without! He's great with kids but because of his size and how clumsy he is we think kids ten and older would be the best fit. He also does well with other dogs but will need a dog that can handle his exuberant play. We don't believe he's had any ""formal"" training but he's extremely smart, attentive and willing to learn so training should be a fun activity for his new owner. If our incredibly charming boy sounds like a good fit for your lifestyle, please give Toni a call at 602-686-4158 or email azbullygirl@hotmail.com - don't make Dobbins wait any longer.

General temperament (e.g. good with other animals (dogs, cats) &/or people/kids, house/litter-trained, other personal habits):  Super loving and friendly, eager to please and affectionate. He is great with other dogs large and small, and very gentle with children. We don't have cats so I am unsure about how he would be with them.

03/19/2016	TYSON - Pit Bull Terrier (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Charlotte, NC	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier (medium coat). Tyson is a very energetic and playful dog. He would do best in a home with no kids, no elderly, and no cats. He''d do well with active owners who would play with him, exercise him, and train him. He is very jumpy and can be mouthy as well if not given mental and physical exercise. When properly trained and exercised each day, he''s fun to hang out with! He has a very rough playstyle and many dogs would not be able to handle it. It is not recommended that he go to dog parks, and a dog dog test is highly recommended if adopters have a dog. If well managed, he will be a great dog for the right adopter.

Please contact Bob (BobKnapp@hebisd.edu) for more information about this pet.Some pets are in the Shelter and others in Foster homes. Scroll thru description for contact info!! Or you may email trinitygapclub@gmail.com for pet info! Update from foster Dad:  I kept her name, but changed the spelling. I think she would probably use a heart to dot the i. Abbi once featured on Fox4's SPCA pet of the day and again found herself homeless last week at the shelter. So I decided to foster her and help her find a forever home! Her compact size maximizes her snuggle factor. Will chase ball for food.   Abbey – ID# Unknown - Owner surrender with canine companion Luna – Catahoula/Staffordshire Mix - Spayed, vaccinated, housetrained – sociable – good with other dogs.  She's amazing. She's the most in your face, loving, caring and beautiful little girl. I got her from the SPCA the day I saw her on Fox 4 News' pet of the day. I saw her and I instantly fell in love, as has anyone that's met her. She's an energetic little thing who loves to be the center of attention. When she's not around others, she likes to make herself busy by running around all over the place. She's the most amazing little cuddle buddy (after she gets comfortable, that is), and she's light to boot, making it a little easier to cuddle with her. She's roughly 3 years old and is crate trained, house broken and knows a couple of commands like sit, and stay (when you have her attention). She's great with other dogs, cats (though she may like to traumatize them more than they'd like), and children (smaller children may get overwhelmed by her insatiable need to be by your side when you get home). She's always excited to see you when you get home, and she can lay around and be lazy too. She's been a great little companion, and it breaks my heart to have to give her up.    Abbey is in a foster home so please contact foster dad Bob at BobKnapp@hebisd.edu   Shelter Dogs: Fully Vetted Males are $100 and Fully Vetted Females are $125 (Fully Vetted means the dog has been spayed/neutered, vaccinated, including rabies shot, and heartworm tested) Dogs Not Vetted: Males are $60 and Females are $85 (You will be responsible for taking the dog to be spayed/neutered at Animal Hosp & Clinic of Arlington, within 30 days, and this adoption fee will include the spay/neuter, vaccinations, and rabies shot.

03/19/2016	Isaac - Hound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Canton, CT	Male	Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed (short coat). Meet the very handsome Isaac- his is a true “rags to riches” story. Isaac was found and rescued in quite an emaciated state. As a result of such starvation, Isaac’s recovery took quite a long time…but just look at this truly awesome boy now! Isaac is a happy and healthy guy, ready to begin the new life that awaits him! Isaac is an exceptional boy who will be an absolutely wonderful and loyal companion- he is so very ready to have a home and family to call his own.  Isaac is an approximately 2 year old, 60 lb Hound mix with a white coat and adorable black spots. Isaac is a very relaxed type of pup with a relatively low energy level- though he still loves to play, especially with his toys! He is the type of dog that just provides great company, and that is simply a joy to have around. Isaac is a confident boy and very friendly- he loves his people, and loves to be by your side. A perfect day for Isaac would include a big bone to play with, some treats to enjoy, and you right there next to him. Isaac has done a wonderful job with house training, though it is important to understand that sometimes dogs regress a bit with house training as they adjust to a new home. He is crate trained, and walks beautifully on a leash. In fact, Isaac would love to join you for walks on the leash to enjoy the sunshine and the outdoors. Isaac would rather not be in a home with cats. He does well with other dogs, although he does not like to share his food bowl, which may make it tricky for him to share his home with other dogs. Isaac is an absolutely wonderful dog to have around- he is going to make a very special companion for a very lucky family. Can you provide this sweet fella with the forever home that he so very much deserves?  Interested in learning more about Dog Star Rescue and our adoption process? Please go to www.dogstarrescue.org.

He has excellent manners on a grooming table - and is all around a nice dog! He is looking for someone to bond with and call his family.  How I act when I first meet new people: Friendly! House trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule. My age: Birthdate 5/29/2008 Please note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. To apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application. Please note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home.  You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you. You can also read our adoption tips page for hints and helps on adopting a rescued dog. http://www.carolinapoodlerescue.org/AdoptionTips.shtml or for general information on Carolina Poodle Rescue, please visit our FAQs - http://www.carolinapoodlerescue.org/FAQGeneral.shtml                "

Hello! No, there's no echo in here... there's two of us! We're Bobby and Molli, and we're hanging out in Albany, Oregon with our foster family, hoping and crossing our paws that someone's going to realize that two wet dog noses are better than one, and give us a home together! Because we've been together forever, and we'd really, really like to stay that way! Our foster mom says we are the best fosters she has ever had! That’s a direct quote (I heard her say it to a lady on the phone). I think it’s because we are just so darn cool. My sister, Molli, and I come from the great outdoors, but we’ve taken to the indoors like bees to honey. And let me tell you, this indoor thing is SWEET! We’ve got fluffy beds in our crates and there are three boys that give us treats when we sit and smile. And let me tell you, we are doing A LOT of smiling. Some of our favorite things to do include taking walks around the neighborhood, watching the kids play at the park, and running along the river bank in the woods. We are the kind of dogs you can take anywhere! And, we get along with EVERYONE! We like babies and toddlers, little kids, big kids, new people we meet at the park, all our foster parent’s friends, our foster fur brother, the mailman, and even the kitty! Sometimes other dogs will walk by the window and we are just so excited, we let them know. Our mom tells us that we don’t have to talk to everyone, and we understand that, but we’re just so happy to tell people our story! Hopefully we will find a great family to adopt us in our next chapter… Please fill out our application soon! http://www.nwboxerrescue.org/#!adoption-form/c1dw9  If you would like to adopt him, fill out an adoption application on our website www.nwboxerrescue.org    Like us on facebook for more photos of this handsome boy, as well as other boxers we have available! www.facebook.com/northwestboxerrescue

I am MOZART, a handsome gray Weimaraner with a natural tail. I was found as a stray, so not too much is known about me yet. I am a shy boy who takes a little bit to warm up to you. I am a little skittish when walking on streets busy with cars and traffic. I am house trained and crate trained. I also am a smart boy who wants to learn new things and picks up on them pretty quickly. I am not good with cats, but seem to be okay with other dogs.    My ideal new home would work with me on learning the house rules and other commands. They would keep me socialized with people and other dogs, understanding that I can be intimidated at first. They would also not have any cats. Would you consider giving me a forever home?  Please ask about MOZART when you contact Weimaraner Rescue of Texas. For donations, please make your check payable to: Weimaraner Rescue of Texas, Inc. 4347 W. Northwest Hwy, Suite 130, Box 184 Dallas, TX 75220 Phone: (972) 994-3572 www.weimrescuetexas.org  We gratefully accept donations of any amount to help our beautiful gray & blue friends in need.

Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!  Chuck is a handsome 2 year old, 64 pound male pit bull who is not too happy staying at the shelter instead of spending what should be great times at a home as part of a family. Chuck seems to be house trained and loves to go outside but living inside as your sidekick to any football game or party you have is his real joy. He does love his humans and wants to spend time with them. Chuck would make a great running partner as he is big and strong and always ready to go. He is pretty good on the leash walking or running. He does not seem to like other dogs and we are unsure how he feels about cats so Chuck should be an only pet. He needs daily activity, walking, running, playing and training to learn new things. He's always ready for a challenge! He is waiting at the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center which is located at 341 S Birdneck Rd in Va Beach. His ID # is 1512-0649. Just ask to visit w/ him!       Virginia Beach Animal Care & Adoption Center has wonderful pets available for adoption. As of December 6, all animals are now at the new shelter at 341 Birdneck Road.

Bruno is a 2 year old pit mix that came to us as a stray. He's got some learning to do as far as manners and such, but he means no harm. He may jump a little, but he really just wants to give you a hug. He might be a little here, there and everywhere while on a walk, but honestly he's just so happy to be given the chance to explore a little that he's got to make sure he doesn't miss one single thing. If he could find a person that will be patient and kind to him while teaching him a little about focusing then he would be as happy as he could be. Because Bruno is a nice boy, and he's worth every minute invested in him! He's also got those all American good looks that will turn heads and a smile that is sure to melt many hearts along the way to finding his forever family. He already knows his basic commands such as sit and he appears to be house trained. I have not seen him around kids, so if you decide to come meet this happy boy then please bring the kids with you to say hello. We want to make sure everyone will want to be friends!

03/19/2016	Harley - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Machesney Park, IL	Male	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Well, hello there! I am part of the Retrievers and Redemption program, and my name is Harley. I am a 7 year old guy who may have some Great Dane in me. I am tall for a Lab, and I do some prancing when I walk. I am super sweet and love to run around with other dogs and LOVE to give you my paw to shake. It's my favorite thing to do. :)  I ride so well in the car that you'll forget that I am there. I just curl up and take a nap. I take treats pretty gently and listen very well. I was surrendered to a shelter because I was having hair loss around my eyes, neck and chest.  The great people at LEARN have put me on a grain free food and treats, and I am already starting to see the results. I am only itching a couple times a day! I am also getting fish oil on my food and a bath once a week with a special shampoo for itchy skin.  I will need to stay on the grain free food and treats for sure and maybe the fish oil. Hopefully I will not need a weekly bath after some time and I feel 100%.  Can you do that for me? If you think that you would like to know more about me or even meet me, please contact LEARN and ask about me, HARLEY!

Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!   Estee Lauder came into our shelter as a stray with her hot boyfriend, Calvin Klein, who has since been adopted. It's time for this beautiful lady to have a happy ending of her very own! Estee is estimated to be about 2 years old and weighs 60 pounds. She is the most gorgeous color that reminds me of sand on the seashore. Her eyes are full of secrets of her past life and dreams of a happy  tomorrow  . Estee is good with most dogs, although she doesn't seem to care for tiny dogs. She's good with kids and is working on her house training. She keep sher kennel clean as long as she can. She's a smart girl with lots of wiggles and the desire to please her person. She likes belly rubs and loves treats. She loves the outdoor and would probably really enjoy a person of her own that will take her on walks or runs and romp around in the yard with her. She's got some polishing that needs to be done with her leash manners as she's a strong girl and does pull when going for a walk. If you have treats, the time and some patience I believe she will be walking at a heel in no time. She just needs a teacher! She knows her basic commands including sit and sometimes stay.

03/19/2016	Domino D160276 - Border Collie / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Borador	Eden Prairie, MN	Male	"Posted Breed: Border Collie / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Name: Domino  Age: Approximate DOB 2/22/12 Gender: Male Breed: Border Collie/Lab mix  Weight: 68 pounds Dog friendly: Yes - companion animal required Cat friendly: Unknown Kid friendly: Yes House trained: Yes Crate trained: Yes Energy level: Moderate History: Abandoned in KY  Adoption Fee: $300  From the Foster:  Domino is a quiet, charming boy that is looking for a special forever home. He has some shyness adjusting to a new situation, but would love to be in a calm home with another confident dog that can show him the way. He would love a fenced yard, as he's not that comfortable yet with a leash, but we're working on that too! He is sweet, yet curious, and watches every move that I make with his foster siblings. He's learning quickly how to take treats from my hand, and let his guard down a little. If you are looking for a good companion for your dog, Dom is your guy. He's definitely a dog's dog, and identifies first with his foster siblings before realizing that his foster mom isn't so bad, either. Domino will need to go to a home where his shyness is ""accepted"", and the family will help him gain the confidence to be the loving dog I know he can be! Not to mention, he's quite the handsome boy!  All dogs are in individual foster homes throughout the Twin Cities.              I f you would like to meet/adopt this animal or anyone else, then please fill out an adoption application at http://secondhandhounds.org/adoption-information/ and the foster(s) will be in touch! Keep in mind that there may be multiple applicants applying for the same animal(s). You only need to complete 1 application for multiple animals that you're interested in.              Note  - We change an animal's listing to say ""PENDING ADOPTION"" when they already had a meet and greet with a family who plans to adopt that animal. We put ""NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS"" on a listing when an animal has multiple applications in and the foster has asked to stop accepting any more while they review the applications they've already received.                               If you would like to be a foster for Secondhand Hounds, then please fill out a foster application,  http://secondhandhounds.org/fostervolunteer-information/fostering-101/  You can choose the type of animal you'd like to foster and we will supply everything you need (food, collar, bowls, crate, etc.) while the animal is in your care.  Thanks for your interest in Secondhand Hounds!                "

The Southampton Animal Shelter''s Outreach Program teamed up with Animal Lighthouse Rescue. This was our second rescue mission to Puerto Rico to SAVE THE SATOS.Puerto Rico is known for its blue skies, palm trees and beautiful beaches, but there is something terrible going on in Puerto Rico. The island has turned into a horrible overpopulation nightmare of backyard breeding, puppy stores, mix breed discrimination, abandoned pets, neglect, mistreatment and abuse. The overpopulation of strays is due to the failure to spay and neuter. There are an estimated 300,000 dogs roaming the streets and dying on the roads and beaches daily.

03/19/2016	Maggie May - Siberian Husky (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Siberian Husky	Hewitt, NJ	Female	Posted Breed: Siberian Husky (medium coat). www.TheLastResortRescue.com PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET THE FIRST STEP IS TO FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION AVAILABLE AT THELASTRESORTRESCUE.COM. WE CANNOT RESPOND TO GENERAL INQUIRES ABOUT A DOG WITHOUT AN APPLICATION ON FILE.   All Maggie May needs is a ‘friend to lend a guiding hand’. Maggie May is named after the Rod Stewart song because that’s what was on the radio when a good Samaritan saved her from roaming the streets and almost being hit by a car! Maggie is a 3 year old Siberian Husky. She’s white and bi-eyed, and a little on the chunky side. Maggie is now settled into her foster home in MD, after the good Samaritan asked TLR to take her in. Maggie May is heartworm positive and we’ve already begun her treatment via slow kill method. The rescue will provide all medication and track her progress until she’s heartworm negative, even if she’s adopted beforehand. Maggie is your typical female Husky. She displays alpha tendencies but can integrate into a pack. Her ideal home would be as an only dog or with another submissive male Sibe. She has a high prey drive so no small animals. Maggie May is particular about her food and it’s apparent she was fed table scraps in her prior life. We’re working on getting her to eat dog food and something a bit more nutritional since she needs to shed a few pounds. Maggie does great in the yard with a 4 ft fence, but needs someone who will walk her regularly and build up her stamina. She’s mostly house trained although she did have a few accidents upon arriving. She’s not overly fond of a crate but with a little coaxing she’ll go in and does fine once inside. She is a vocal girl, as most Huskies are, so no apartments please. We’re working with her on her counter surfing tendencies, which will most likely diminish once she’s on a routine of eating dog food. Maggie May is extremely lovable and playful and will make a wonderful addition into any home.Adoption Application http://www.thelastresortrescue.com/adoptionapplication.htm

03/19/2016	Gus - German Shepherd Dog (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Vacaville, CA	Male	Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (short coat). Adopting A Shelter Dog These dogs come without background histories/ past medical information. We present these dogs as we have observed in relationship to age, size, breed, behavior, housebreaking, crate training, good with children, cats, dogs, and strangers. Dogs may present themselves differently in different environments, therefore The Dog Spot Rescue, their agents, volunteers, can not guarantee behavior, age, size expectations, breed, house Training, destructive behavior tendencies, and/or medical issues. All dogs from shelters have been subjected to pathogens from the shelter level which can materialize into disease in the future. Each adopter must observe for themselves pre-adoption and make decisions for themselves the suitability of said dog and their tolerance levels for transitional time when adopting a shelter dog. We ask that each adopter take their time when making the choice to bring home a rescued dog.Gus is a awesome companion or family dog prospect. Handsome, sweet natured, great dog with kids, other dogs and tested well with cats. (Could chase a running cat) He is affectionate, loves to go to the snow, enjoys water, loves to go places. He is loyal and shepherds are natural guardians. Good in the house, not too barky, crate trained. He is looking for someone who is experienced with German Shepherds or large dogs that will bring him into their home and heart.  Adoption is $400 and includes his neuter, rabies, worming, shots, heartworm test and all dogs go home on a two week trial. Dogs are seen by appointment Saturdays in ELK GROVE, Ca. If interested, please fill out an application at http://www.thedogspotrescue.org/forms/form?formid=850 and then email thedogspotrescue@aol.com.Your Adoption Fee covers the following expenses: Spay/Neuter, DHLPP, Bordatella, Rabies (if age appropriate), De-worming and Frontline/Advantage Please Note: Shelter/rescue dogs have been exposed to many pathogens such as kennel cough, parasites, diseases and conditions some of which may not have been discovered prior to adoption. Any dog that shows symptoms here at TDS are routinely identified, taken for tests and treatment. Our vet bills can exceed $10,000 a month. However, without symptoms, we may miss a disease, or pre-existing condition or parasite. Consider carefully if you have the tolerance for these possibilities. We consider, you, the adopters, the last leg of the rescue process.

She is a 5 year old, 65 lb. standard poodle. She is very loving and enjoys being petted by her human more than anything. Initially ignoring her foster siblings, Coco is finding that being part of the pack might be okay after all. This girl is so laid back! She prefers to spend her evenings lounging on a big dog bed unless there are treats or petting available. Coco is house trained and crate trained and crates during the day. At night, she prefers to choose her own dog bed and stay out of the crate to sleep. She has learned to sit for treats and sit for her meals - Coco is VERY eager to please! She has not been around children with her foster mom, but she has been to an elderly living facility and was quite a hit with the residents. Coco's foster mom has fostered a lot of dogs over the years and says that Coco is probably the easiest she has ever had. CoCo is spayed, vetted, microchipped and ready for her home.

Please contact SSRR (rottie.info.ssrr@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.                        SSRR provides FREE transport to our approved adopters.             Hello! My name is Bear, and my foster mom tells me that I am a very sweet, calm, gentle, affectionate boy. I'm not trying to brag or anything, but I have really good manners and no bad habits. When it's time for bed, I either sleep on my bed in the living room or in my crate in the bedroom. I am an excellent sleeper, too, never waking up my foster mom in the morning because I respect her beauty sleep. She has to wake me up to tell me it's time to go outside before I can have my breakfast. My foster mom has never had to close the door on the crate because I am so well behaved, even when left home alone!       I am such a good boy, I don't chew or steal things that don't belong to me, like the remote control. I also know I am not allowed on the furniture unless my person is sitting there and I want to come up to snuggle. But, I still only do this with two of my paws, so they won't think I'm being bad. If you get on the floor, that signals play time, and I will try to sit on you or playfully nip at your toes. I just love my humans and also love it when they play tug with me.       I also absolutely love going for walks. My foster mom says I'm a quick learner and have already learned to sit and wait politely at the door until I am released. I know not to pull on the leash, too. I do get a little excited when I encounter other dogs, but I just want to play, as it's a playful excitement.       When I'm at home, I also love to be outside and sun myself on the deck. Sometimes I get excited and will run zoomies around the yard. My foster mom thinks that's so funny. I am a good watchdog and will let you know if there is anything unusual that needs investigating.       I am an overall happy boy who will make someone a great pet. I like kids but think I would do best with kids over 12 because I'm such a big boy.                    Step 1:  Please complete the adoption application in full; incomplete applications WILL NOT BE PROCESSED        Step 2: Our Lead Adoption Coordinator will contact you and confirm your application has been received (please use our   Contact Us form     if you have not gotten a response within 7 days).

Step 5: Once the application process is completed, the adoption package goes to the board of directors for a 24 hour review.        SSRR is very serious about the homes our dogs are placed in and want to ensure they never end up homeless again.

03/19/2016	1601-0276 Hercules - Pit Bull Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Virginia Beach, VA	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier. Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet! Hercules looks just how you might imagine a boy named Hercules would look! He is big. He is strong. He is powerful. He's got a huge head just made for kissing! And oh, did I mention he is GQ handsome? This hunky guy is no puppy. At 6 yrs old Hercules is waiting with baited breath to get out of the shelter and start a new life chapter in his own home . Hercules came in with another dog but this doesn't mean he will like every dog he meets. Just like people, we like some and others we'd rather not be around. We have introduced him to a couple quiet, calm, well balanced dogs and he seems to be ok walking with them. Every case is individual with every dog, so please do us a favor and bring your dog to meet Hercules if you think you might be interested in him. We want to set all our dogs up for success! Hercules has been known to charge out of his cage, definitely makes you work to harness him up, and pulls to get out of that shelter. Hey, he's got things to do and places to see and it's not happening until he makes it outside! Once outside of the kennels and shelter stress, Hercules is a really nice boy who walks well on the leash, seems to be house trained and takes treats very gentle! He also knows the sit command and loves to run and play in the barnyard. Hercules is looking for a forever home with a patient new person to call his own where he will be given the opportunity to get used to his new surroundings and his new life. He will also need some daily exercise and training time to learn new tricks and manners which will help create that ideal bond with his new family. It's a win/win situation! If you are ready to take on the challenge of a boy that promises to turn heads every time you have him out in public then please come to the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center located at 341 S Birdneck Rd in Va Beach and ask to see Hercules! His ID # is 1601-0276. I bet you'll be happy you did! Virginia Beach Animal Care & Adoption Center has wonderful pets available for adoption.

03/19/2016	Stone D160186 - Rottweiler (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler	Eden Prairie, MN	Male	"Posted Breed: Rottweiler (short coat). Name: Stone Age: Approximate DOB 2/8/14 Gender: Male Breed: Rottweiler (mix?) Weight: 86 pounds Dog friendly: Yes  Cat friendly: No Kid friendly: Yes House trained: Yes Crate trained: Yes Energy level: Moderate History: Stray in MO  Adoption Fee: $350  From the Foster:  Stone is a big guy who’s friendly with everyone he meets. He loves the dog park and running in the yard, as a home with a fenced yard is just what he needs. Given his young age, he’s very playful and still has some of his puppy energy but has learned to redirect it when getting too excited. We aren’t sure what he’s been through before he made it to SHH/Us but he took 4-5 days to settle in as he didn’t like being left alone at first but now has no issues with it what so ever. He gets along great with my male 60lb Husky as well as other dogs at the dog park. Being as big as he is, he can intimidate smaller dogs with his curious nose but it’s all from a place of love and has never shown aggression to any. He wants nothing more then to be in the same room as you and lay at your feet. He’s a good looking puppy ready to find his forever home! All dogs are in individual foster homes throughout the Twin Cities.               I f you would like to meet/adopt this animal or anyone else, then please fill out an adoption application at http://secondhandhounds.org/adoption-information/ and the foster(s) will be in touch! Keep in mind that there may be multiple applicants applying for the same animal(s). You only need to complete 1 application for multiple animals that you're interested in.               Note  - We change an animal's listing to say ""PENDING ADOPTION"" when they already had a meet and greet with a family who plans to adopt that animal. We put ""NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS"" on a listing when an animal has multiple applications in and the foster has asked to stop accepting any more while they review the applications they've already received.                               If you would like to be a foster for Secondhand Hounds, then please fill out a foster application,  http://secondhandhounds.org/fostervolunteer-information/fostering-101/ You can choose the type of animal you'd like to foster and we will supply everything you need (food, collar, bowls, crate, etc.) while the animal is in your care.

03/19/2016	Dude - Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Sanford, FL	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). Dude was rescued last minute from a high kill shelter by a caring individual who couldn't see this big love put down! This person is also fostering him and has this to say about him:He is very playful and affectionate. He loves to chase his ball and play fetch. He knows basic commands (sit, down, stay, come, drop it, leave it). We are working on being easy on the leash. I think he just pulls because he is stuck in the bedroom all day and gets excited to be out.  A fenced in yard would be ideal but not necessary. Dude should be an only pet as he is not yet socialized with dogs or cats.                
03/19/2016	Sae Dee - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Temple, GA	Female	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat). ADOPT WITH PEACE OF MIND!   Most of our adoptable dogs are trained, socialized and ready to love your family. They have lived at our home-based boarding, training and rescue facility where we have worked to fully assess them so that we can help you make a perfect match with your new companion. For over 15 years, we have worked with owners and dogs with training and rehabilitation. We bring these skills to our rescue program to help you and/or your family find the perfect new dog that fits your lifestyle, activity level, home environment and personality. We pride ourselves on working closely with you to not only find the perfect dog, but to provide service and care for you and your new companion after adoption. The majority of our dogs receive formal training and we do several obedience lessons prior to adoption so that you and your new dog can learn to work together and, equally or more importantly, bond prior to going home. You can read more about our adoption process below this description of this incredible, adoptable dog! We also off adoptions for senior and special needs dogs, small breed dogs that do not require training for adoption (but that can be trained at the adopter's request), and our new HomeBuddies program, which is FREE and helps harder to place dogs find loving homes and includes training.  Our HomeBuddies adoptions will require strict screening and matching. These adoptions focus on dogs that are well-behaved and loving, but may have specific issues that have not responded to training. Some examples include socialization issues with other dogs or not being able to be around small children (not aggressive, but reactive to things like grabbing or quick jerky movements). These are loving dogs that deserve a chance at a forever home, but that will require special homes (i.e. no children, no other dogs, etc.). They each do include our 14 Day Off Leash Express program and the only expense is the cost of a remote collar that comes with the program (approx $200). ADOPTION FEES: Adoption with 28 Day OFF LEASH ULTIMATE TRAINING program $937.50 (dogs that will complete our full service training program normally priced $1749; includes 20% off boarding for life, private lessons for life, 24/7 support, remote training collar) Adoption with 14 Day OFF LEASH EXPRESS program $699.00 (dogs that will complete our full service training program normally priced $999; includes 20% off boarding for life, private lessons for life, 24/7 support, remote training collar) Small Breed without training (dogs under 30 pounds) $350 - fenced yard required Senior or Special Needs Adoptable $200 or negotiable based on dog and home (dogs 8+ yrs or dogs with special needs) Service Dog Candidates $450 (dogs leaving LILR and immediately entering service dog training; requires meeting with trainer) HOMEBUDDIES $FREE (INCLUDES our 14 day OFF LEASH EXPRESS program; difficult to place dogs that may have behavior issues that have not been responsive to training, but will still make great companions when matched with the right home; only expense is the cost of a remote training collar at $200) ***To find out which programs this dog is eligible for, please email info@lifeislabs.org as it varies with each dog, how long they've been with us and their general behavior and temperament. ALL ADOPTIONS INCLUDE: Full vaccinations, spay or neuter, parasite (fleat/tick/all worms) free, current on parasite prevention, microchipped, 20% off boarding for life at our facility. 24/7 access to us for anything you need related to your adopted dog.  FULL SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM ADOPTIONS ALSO INCLUDE: Unlimited private lessons for life and a remote collar. We do NOT do adoptions without our training program unless the dog is senior, special needs or a service dog candidate. OUR ADOPTION PROCESS 1.  Complete our adoption application. It usually takes our volunteers 1-2 business days to process your adoption application. 2.  Once your application is approved, set up a visit (by appointment please so that we can be available for you) to our facility to visit with the dogs that meet your preferences based on your application. You can visit more than once if you need more time to help choose a new companion. 3.  Once you select your companion, we may do a home visit. 4.  Complete an adoption contract. Dogs that are not receiving formal training can go home at this time. 5.  For dogs who have been trained, we typically have two-three visits/lessons, with the last being the day you take your new pup home. This timeframe and the lessons can vary by dog and adoptive individual and family. FOR ADOPTIONS RECEIVING OUR FULL SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM: THIS IS **NOT** your typical ""pet store"" or group class training. The result is a dog that you can enjoy in any setting and know that it's safe and a pleasure for everyone it visits with. You will be able to run, bike, hike, camp, garden and just plain relax with a dog that isn't going to run off or cause trouble. With the exception of seniors and special needs dogs, all of our adoptables receive either our ""28 Day Off Leash Ultimate"" or our ""14 Day Off Leash Express"" training program, which is available to the general public.  If you are adopting a puppy, they will go home with you and then come back around 6-8 months to complete their training. Our training program includes behavior training, socialization and obedience training. When dogs complete our program, they will walk with you both on leash and off, we have addressed any manners/behavior issues that would cause problems in their new homes and they will come when called reliably off leash. Some dogs do have lingering issues that we fully disclose -- the most common is dogs that can jump 4' fences (which is probably why they ended up in the shelter in the first place!).  When you come out for lessons, our typical lessons are: 1) leash walking, 2) gate and door manners, 3) coming when called to all family members and sitting upon arrival, 4) going for a walk off-leash with family and staying safely in the general area and returning immediately when called. Your new dog is ready to go home when we've completed the lessons and both you and we are confident and comfortable with your new pup's relationship and response to you and your family. Our adoptions with full service training include a dog that is:  Spayed or neutered Current on all vaccinations Clear of parasites (heartworm, flea, tick, worms, etc.) Current on all parasite prevention (heartworm and flea/tick prevention) Microchipped On a high-quality food (Merrick Whole Earth Farms) Fully assessed for temperament and behavior Crate trained Fully trained through our ""28 Day Off Leash"" (reg $1749) or ""14 Day Off Leash Express"" (reg $999) training program -- for dogs eligible for training  These adoptions also include:  Private lessons prior to adoption and UNLIMITED private lessons as needed once adoption is complete (for dogs that have completed training) 20% off boarding at any of our facilities for life Unlimited access to us for advice and assistance for ANYTHING you need in relationship to your adopted dog  The nature of our rescue program requires that dogs are with us typically 2-3 months from the time we take them into our program. During this time, they are living in and around our home with a variety of other dogs, cats, cows, people and general activity. We are assessing them 24/7 so that we know them very well and can confidently help you make the perfect match for a new companion. And we are training them daily (once they are happy and healthy) to prepare them for adoption. Payment arrangements can be made in the form of 50% down at the time of adoption and the remaining 50% in one month from that date. We understand that some people are shocked by this adoption fee. Please understand that this is NOT about making money. We care for 40 or more dogs in our program on a daily basis. All of our dogs are here typically 2-3 or more times longer than most rescues in other programs. We feed them high quality food, administer parasite prevention and provide food, toys, bedding, crates and a staff that helps care for them while we assess their behavior and temperament and conduct training. ALL of the proceeds from our adoptions go directly back to our rescue program. NONE of the adoption fee goes to us for training or boarding. Our adoption fee was set by taking a traditional adoption fee of $250 and then adding our commercial training program at half price (687.50 -- when it was originally $1375). We originally offered the training as an option. Almost every adopter did the training. The few that didn't were calling with behavior and training issues. We felt that there is a value to our training, both to the adopter, but even more importantly to the dog. We want our dogs to be LOVED and to become INSEPARABLE members of the family. We don't want them to cause stress or frustration. So in early 2011, we decided that all of our rescues would be trained. We hope that most people can see the value in the training and we encourage you to come out to visit and see the training in action if you are a potential adopter that's skeptical or on the fence. This is not traditional sit/stay training. This is training that will give you a well-balanced dog that is a pleasure 24/7. They are not little robots and they are not 100% without fault.

03/19/2016	Earbie - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Temple, GA	Male	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat). ADOPT WITH PEACE OF MIND!   Most of our adoptable dogs are trained, socialized and ready to love your family. They have lived at our home-based boarding, training and rescue facility where we have worked to fully assess them so that we can help you make a perfect match with your new companion. For over 15 years, we have worked with owners and dogs with training and rehabilitation. We bring these skills to our rescue program to help you and/or your family find the perfect new dog that fits your lifestyle, activity level, home environment and personality. We pride ourselves on working closely with you to not only find the perfect dog, but to provide service and care for you and your new companion after adoption. The majority of our dogs receive formal training and we do several obedience lessons prior to adoption so that you and your new dog can learn to work together and, equally or more importantly, bond prior to going home. You can read more about our adoption process below this description of this incredible, adoptable dog! We also off adoptions for senior and special needs dogs, small breed dogs that do not require training for adoption (but that can be trained at the adopter's request), and our new HomeBuddies program, which is FREE and helps harder to place dogs find loving homes and includes training.  Our HomeBuddies adoptions will require strict screening and matching. These adoptions focus on dogs that are well-behaved and loving, but may have specific issues that have not responded to training. Some examples include socialization issues with other dogs or not being able to be around small children (not aggressive, but reactive to things like grabbing or quick jerky movements). These are loving dogs that deserve a chance at a forever home, but that will require special homes (i.e. no children, no other dogs, etc.). They each do include our 14 Day Off Leash Express program and the only expense is the cost of a remote collar that comes with the program (approx $200). ADOPTION FEES: Adoption with 28 Day OFF LEASH ULTIMATE TRAINING program $937.50 (dogs that will complete our full service training program normally priced $1749; includes 20% off boarding for life, private lessons for life, 24/7 support, remote training collar) Adoption with 14 Day OFF LEASH EXPRESS program $699.00 (dogs that will complete our full service training program normally priced $999; includes 20% off boarding for life, private lessons for life, 24/7 support, remote training collar) Small Breed without training (dogs under 30 pounds) $350 - fenced yard required Senior or Special Needs Adoptable $200 or negotiable based on dog and home (dogs 8+ yrs or dogs with special needs) Service Dog Candidates $450 (dogs leaving LILR and immediately entering service dog training; requires meeting with trainer) HOMEBUDDIES $FREE (INCLUDES our 14 day OFF LEASH EXPRESS program; difficult to place dogs that may have behavior issues that have not been responsive to training, but will still make great companions when matched with the right home; only expense is the cost of a remote training collar at $200) ***To find out which programs this dog is eligible for, please email info@lifeislabs.org as it varies with each dog, how long they've been with us and their general behavior and temperament. ALL ADOPTIONS INCLUDE: Full vaccinations, spay or neuter, parasite (fleat/tick/all worms) free, current on parasite prevention, microchipped, 20% off boarding for life at our facility. 24/7 access to us for anything you need related to your adopted dog.  FULL SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM ADOPTIONS ALSO INCLUDE: Unlimited private lessons for life and a remote collar. We do NOT do adoptions without our training program unless the dog is senior, special needs or a service dog candidate. OUR ADOPTION PROCESS 1.  Complete our adoption application. It usually takes our volunteers 1-2 business days to process your adoption application. 2.  Once your application is approved, set up a visit (by appointment please so that we can be available for you) to our facility to visit with the dogs that meet your preferences based on your application. You can visit more than once if you need more time to help choose a new companion. 3.  Once you select your companion, we may do a home visit. 4.  Complete an adoption contract. Dogs that are not receiving formal training can go home at this time. 5.  For dogs who have been trained, we typically have two-three visits/lessons, with the last being the day you take your new pup home. This timeframe and the lessons can vary by dog and adoptive individual and family. FOR ADOPTIONS RECEIVING OUR FULL SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM: THIS IS **NOT** your typical ""pet store"" or group class training. The result is a dog that you can enjoy in any setting and know that it's safe and a pleasure for everyone it visits with. You will be able to run, bike, hike, camp, garden and just plain relax with a dog that isn't going to run off or cause trouble. With the exception of seniors and special needs dogs, all of our adoptables receive either our ""28 Day Off Leash Ultimate"" or our ""14 Day Off Leash Express"" training program, which is available to the general public.  If you are adopting a puppy, they will go home with you and then come back around 6-8 months to complete their training. Our training program includes behavior training, socialization and obedience training. When dogs complete our program, they will walk with you both on leash and off, we have addressed any manners/behavior issues that would cause problems in their new homes and they will come when called reliably off leash. Some dogs do have lingering issues that we fully disclose -- the most common is dogs that can jump 4' fences (which is probably why they ended up in the shelter in the first place!).  When you come out for lessons, our typical lessons are: 1) leash walking, 2) gate and door manners, 3) coming when called to all family members and sitting upon arrival, 4) going for a walk off-leash with family and staying safely in the general area and returning immediately when called. Your new dog is ready to go home when we've completed the lessons and both you and we are confident and comfortable with your new pup's relationship and response to you and your family. Our adoptions with full service training include a dog that is:  Spayed or neutered Current on all vaccinations Clear of parasites (heartworm, flea, tick, worms, etc.) Current on all parasite prevention (heartworm and flea/tick prevention) Microchipped On a high-quality food (Merrick Whole Earth Farms) Fully assessed for temperament and behavior Crate trained Fully trained through our ""28 Day Off Leash"" (reg $1749) or ""14 Day Off Leash Express"" (reg $999) training program -- for dogs eligible for training  These adoptions also include:  Private lessons prior to adoption and UNLIMITED private lessons as needed once adoption is complete (for dogs that have completed training) 20% off boarding at any of our facilities for life Unlimited access to us for advice and assistance for ANYTHING you need in relationship to your adopted dog  The nature of our rescue program requires that dogs are with us typically 2-3 months from the time we take them into our program. During this time, they are living in and around our home with a variety of other dogs, cats, cows, people and general activity. We are assessing them 24/7 so that we know them very well and can confidently help you make the perfect match for a new companion. And we are training them daily (once they are happy and healthy) to prepare them for adoption. Payment arrangements can be made in the form of 50% down at the time of adoption and the remaining 50% in one month from that date. We understand that some people are shocked by this adoption fee. Please understand that this is NOT about making money. We care for 40 or more dogs in our program on a daily basis. All of our dogs are here typically 2-3 or more times longer than most rescues in other programs. We feed them high quality food, administer parasite prevention and provide food, toys, bedding, crates and a staff that helps care for them while we assess their behavior and temperament and conduct training. ALL of the proceeds from our adoptions go directly back to our rescue program. NONE of the adoption fee goes to us for training or boarding. Our adoption fee was set by taking a traditional adoption fee of $250 and then adding our commercial training program at half price (687.50 -- when it was originally $1375). We originally offered the training as an option. Almost every adopter did the training. The few that didn't were calling with behavior and training issues. We felt that there is a value to our training, both to the adopter, but even more importantly to the dog. We want our dogs to be LOVED and to become INSEPARABLE members of the family. We don't want them to cause stress or frustration. So in early 2011, we decided that all of our rescues would be trained. We hope that most people can see the value in the training and we encourage you to come out to visit and see the training in action if you are a potential adopter that's skeptical or on the fence. This is not traditional sit/stay training. This is training that will give you a well-balanced dog that is a pleasure 24/7. They are not little robots and they are not 100% without fault. But when you have a dog that you can travel with, hang out with, go to the mailbox with and that your friends and family can enjoy, we know that we've done our job by matching you with a dog that's a true companion and not just a pet...

Biggy is crate trained, but also loves his snuggles! He loves nothing more than curling up on the couch with the family for some down time! Biggy enjoys being outdoors where he likes to burn off some of his energy! He came upon his name honestly, as he has a big personality in a mid size package!

03/19/2016	Mocha - German Shepherd Dog (long coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog	Baton Rouge, LA	Female	"Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog (long coat). Mocha is a gorgeous, adult, female German Shepherd Dog. We estimate that she's probably 4-5 years old, in the prime of her life. Mocha recently tested negative for heartworms, and she's spayed, microchipped, and up-to-date on vaccinations. Her structure and appearance suggests that she likely comes from working lines: she has the thick-boned, strong, straight-backed look of DDR (East German) lines. Mocha also has the personality of these lines: intelligent, dominant, protective of her people, with high prey drive.  She's not an appropriate ""starter dog"" for a first-time Shepherd owner, but she's an incredible dog for an experienced GSD lover who appreciates and understands this kind of dog. Mocha has been great with all the people she's met, and she's even okay with other large dogs in a dog park under supervision.  However, she cannot live with small animals or other female dogs in the home. We strongly prefer to place Mocha as an ""only dog"" in a home where she can bond deeply with her person, without competing for attention with another dog. At home, Mocha loves belly rubs and affection from her people. She's loving and very devoted to her family. She is, however an ""alpha female"" who requires an experienced handler (for this reason, a professional training reference is required).  Mocha is looking for a breed-experienced adopter who understand the ""drive"" of working line dogs--especially prey-drive. She needs more than a walk and some basic training: she needs a job. She has the potential to thrive doing advanced obedience, or dog sports.  She is already house-trained and crate-trained.  A completed adoption application, with vet and personal references, and a home check are required to apply to adopt. Please list your trainer reference as one of your 2 personal references in the application. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application: http://www.RedStickGermanShepherds.org. Applications are approved solely in the discretion of the RSGSR board of directors.                "

Chrissy has absolutely gorgeous classic markings. As beautiful as she is, she lacks the confidence to know how great she is. Whatever her previous experience, it has left her very shy and fearful. She wants very much to please and has come to trust the care workers she's familiar with. However, she is still very frightened with new people. The right person for Chrissy will be a patient soul who is willing to give her the time she needs to feel safe and loved. Once she can relax and be herself, that person will be rewarded with amazing loyalty and affection.

Adopting A Shelter Dog These dogs come without background histories/ past medical information. We present these dogs as we have observed in relationship to age, size, breed, behavior, housebreaking, crate training, good with children, cats, dogs, and strangers. Dogs may present themselves differently in different environments, therefore The Dog Spot Rescue, their agents, volunteers, can not guarantee behavior, age, size expectations, breed, house Training, destructive behavior tendencies, and/or medical issues. All dogs from shelters have been subjected to pathogens from the shelter level which can materialize into disease in the future. Each adopter must observe for themselves pre-adoption and make decisions for themselves the suitability of said dog and their tolerance levels for transitional time when adopting a shelter dog. We ask that each adopter take their time when making the choice to bring home a rescued dog.Gentle family dog looking for HOME Nelly is one of the sweetest dogs in our program. She is sad however because she does not have a human to call her own. Nelly just loves very deeply and is lost without a connection. She is great with the other dogs here, but her focus is really on people. When you give her attention, her tail wags, her eyes light up. Nelly is good in the yard, no digging, barking, or fence climbing. She has been great in the house, calm, cool, well behaved. Can use a doggy door. Enjoys walks, car rides, trips to the ocean, trips to the snow. LOVES round beds and toys. She has been tested with cats. She had some interest and if a cat ran, she would likely chase. If it was a confident cat that didnt run, she likely will be fine with supervision. If interested in Nelly, please fill out an on line form at: thedogspot.rescuegroups.org and then contact us for a meet and gret appointment by w-mailing: thedogspotrescue@aol.com. Adoption is $250.00 (has a sponsor who paid the rest) and it includes her spay, shots, rabies, heartworm test, bordetella, chip, drontal. She is waiting to meet you. Comes with a two week post adoption trial period. Your Adoption Fee covers the following expenses: Spay/Neuter, DHLPP, Bordatella, Rabies (if age appropriate), De-worming and Frontline/Advantage Please Note: Shelter/rescue dogs have been exposed to many pathogens such as kennel cough, parasites, diseases and conditions some of which may not have been discovered prior to adoption. Any dog that shows symptoms here at TDS are routinely identified, taken for tests and treatment. Our vet bills can exceed $10,000 a month. However, without symptoms, we may miss a disease, or pre-existing condition or parasite. Consider carefully if you have the tolerance for these possibilities. We consider, you, the adopters, the last leg of the rescue process.                
03/19/2016	Missy - Boxer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Fort Lauderdale, FL	Female	"Posted Breed: Boxer (short coat). Missy is a female, full-bred Boxer, approx 8 yrs old. She is great with people but, has some fear-aggression with other dogs and small children. She was tied to a tree and abandoned in a park; and then her last ""dad"" called me on Christmas Day to say he was taking her to the Humane Society because she ate a box of chocolates that he left out on the counter (unbelievable!). So, I immediately collected her and her things and brought her to my home.    It's clear that she's had a rough life, which is probably the cause of the fear-aggression. Also, I don't think her last dad gave her enough attention and exercise. Thus the counter-surfing.  She's healthy, spayed and has up to date shots. She just needs a loving home with people who understand her and will not give her up for something as inconsequential as a box of chocolate.    If adopted by someone in East Ft Lauderdale to East Deerfield area, she'll get a great rate for walks and overnight stays from Angels Pet Sitting!Please contact Wendy for more information about this sweet sweet dog.

Please contact Eppright for more information about this pet.Hi! My name is Bear, and I'm a beautiful Golden Shepherd boy. I'm housebroken and comfortable being crated when it's time for a time-out and a tasty treat. In my old house I lived with 2 cats and 5 other dogs, and here I live with 4 other dogs and we are fast friends already. I seem to love everybody, especially children. I sit quietly while they pat me and give me friendly hugs. Don't get me wrong, I love to run and play, too. I'm well-rounded :) My foster mom says that I have some anxiety when it's stormy and there is thunder. This is because I was chained outside all of the time without shelter when I was younger. My human and the other dogs in the house are teaching me that storms aren't scary when I'm safe inside. I'm extremely smart and so it won't be long until it's no longer a concern. I need to be primarily an inside dog. When my people are home, I want to be with them, curled up with a chew or a toy or a best dog buddy. I will stay outside during the day when you are at work if I have a dog buddy, but if I'm the only canine then I prefer to stay in the house. Otherwise, I'll be tempted to roam the neighborhood looking for some company. My foster mom says that I am quite the package of beauty, intelligence, loyalty, love and playfulness. Email her if you would like to meet me at an adoption event.

If you're looking for a best buddy to hang out on the couch with, Hooch is your guy. Hooch is good with two walks a day and a comfy spot to curl up in at home. He is house and crate trained and is fine staying out in the house while we're at work.   One thing that Hooch is not too fond of is staircases! He does ok with a few stairs at a time but will not go up larger staircases, so an upper duplex or apartment is not for him. Hooch also has allergies which will require some ongoing meds and regular baths.   Hooch is pretty smart and so far has proven that you can teach an old dog new tricks! He is also friendly with every single person he meets and he greets everyone with a big tail wag. He has lots of love to share with a forever family!!

We put ""NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS"" on a listing when an animal has multiple applications in and the foster has asked to stop accepting any more while they review the applications they've already received.

Riley is a sweet natured dog with an excess of energy. He has had no training and behaves like a large puppy. He has a history that possibly includes harassing or killing chickens and small dogs. He would do best with an energetic owner who has time to spend with him. Due to his possible history he would likely do best in a home without livestock or small animals.

She ""guards"" her humans against other dogs and demands lots of attention. Sable is also dominant with other dogs. She is good with kids. Her need to seek attention may be too much for little ones.With some training and proper boundaries, Sable will be an incredible dog.

Don’t let his size fool you – he’s such a love bug! Juice loves life and everything it has to offer, making him a fun one to have around. A day filled with long walks/runs, a friendly game of fetch, and lots and lots of people time constitute Juice’s idea of the perfect day! He’s also a quick study and very intelligent, making him quite the well-rounded teenage dog. Although Juice thinks people are the greatest and makes friends with everybody, he is not fond of other dogs. However, a recent modified cat test suggested that he is not bothered by cats. Our staff have become very attached to this one and want to see him go to a rescue/foster where he can be indulged with all of his favorite things while he continues to wait for the lifelong home he so very much deserves. Let’s all work together to get Juice out of the shelter!

We rescue these kids from the streets!!!  Meet Jersey Girl and her 6 pack of puppies! Jersey Girl and babies were the victims of an all-too-common situation where couples break up & their furkids wind up at the pound.

03/19/2016	Emerson - German Shorthaired Pointer / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shorthaired Lab	Fargo, ND	Female	Posted Breed: German Shorthaired Pointer / Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). {s3829code380/} If you would like to provide this dog a loving home, please fill out a pre-adoption application.     Have a question? Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.   Statistics    Name: Emerson Breed: German Shorthaired Pointer - Labrador Retriever Mix Age: 5 Years Size: Large Adoption Donation: $180 (applicable sales tax included). Adoption fees may be paid with cash or check. Other: Spayed Female, vaccinations current, microchip       Emerson would love someone to teach her to be a great dog!        Foster Home Feedback   2/20/16: Emerson has been with us for 4 weeks and is doing very well. She is potty trained and crate trained. (She can escape from a wire crate but not a plastic crate.) She's great on a leash, walks very well with our dogs and walks or runs about 3-5 miles per day. Regular exercise, both mental and physical, is very important for her since she is a high energy dog. It keeps her happy and gives her an appropriate outlet for her energy. In addition, she does have some separation anxiety but as long as we follow a very simple plan with exercise and good treats when we leave, it has not been an issue. Emerson is very smart. She goes to training every week and is learning very quickly. Since she was an outdoor dog prior to coming to the rescue, she has had to adjust to living in a home and learn basic obedience. She has come so far so quickly! Every now and then, she will try to counter surf and sometimes will carry around a household item but she immediately complies when we redirect her. We've introduced Emerson to children and she's been very good with them. She was very gentle with a toddler she met. She should be supervised around small children that are unstable on their feet because she is so active. Emerson would be happiest living with another dog, preferably a more mellow dog. She gets along very well with our dogs but may require slow introductions with some dogs. Emerson has a lot of love to give, she is very devoted to her people and is hoping to find her forever home.To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org                
03/19/2016	BusterD16 - Cattle Dog / Saint Bernard / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Saint Bernard-Unknown Mix	The Woodlands, TX	Male	Posted Breed: Cattle Dog / Saint Bernard / Mixed (medium coat). Please contact Goldstein for more information about this pet.Freckle-faced Buster is about 2 years old and very playful. He will romp and play with you and then happily crash on the couch with you at the end of the day. He grew up in a household full of other male and female dogs and two cats, so he knows how to get along with others. He will even share toys, but of course wants quiet crate time to happily devour treats and chews that he doesn't have to share with anybody :) He is house-trained and already neutered. Buster has met children at adoption events and seems to like them just fine. Given his breed background, he is very devoted to his people and can act protective of them, but when his human indicates that it's ok, he enjoys meeting people and receiving belly rubs and compliments. He has led a very sheltered life from puppyhood. Until the past month he had never been outside of his yard, had never met other dogs, and still has never been boarded. He exhibits a little bit of anxiety when faced with new living situations, but he quickly settles in to established routines and bonds with his family. Pictures and words cannot adequately convey his charms, nor the softness of this cute boy's gorgeous coat. Email us if you would like to meet Buster, and bring something comfortable to land on when you fall for him :)                
03/19/2016	1603-0386 Queen - Pit Bull Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Virginia Beach, VA	Female	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier. Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!  Queen is a big blue girl that has some talents that she would love to share with the right family! She's got the basics down, you know, she's crate and house trained and knows the sit command. However, the best thing I saw her do yesterday was yodel. She yodels for chicken nuggets! And she's not shy about it. She sang me a song all the way home from buying those nuggets. It was adorable and pitiful at the same time, because she was really serious about wanting those nuggets! I expected her to grab it out of my hand with gusto when she was finally offered one, but she totally caught me off guard when she took it nice and gentle, just like the lady that she is! Queen is about 3 years old and weighs in at a solid 60ish pounds. Her surrender papers say she doesn't play with other dogs or cats, however, we had her around a dog and she was non reactive. I wonder sometimes if these dogs just were the only dog in the home and it is unknown. However, with that being said, we will try to find her a home with no other dogs until we know otherwise. She's a big girl. She wants a lap to sit in. She walks nicely on a leash and she loves toys. If you are looking for a big blue cuddle bug then please stop by Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 S Birdneck Road and ask to meet Queen. She may still be in the back waiting for a spot on the adoption floor so just ask up front for Queen, ID# 1603-0386, and we will have someone bring her out to meet you. Thank you for considering adoption!  Virginia Beach Animal Care & Adoption Center has wonderful pets available for adoption. As of December 6, all animals are now at the new shelter at 341 Birdneck Road. The former shelter on Leroy Drive is now closed.

IF THERE IS NO CONTACT INFORMATION LISTED, PLEASE CONTACT OUR REHOMING COORDINATOR AT STEPHANIE@BULLYPAWS.ORG.  Let me show you my SMILE!!! MITZY NEEDS A FOREVER HOME!!!! Name: Mitzy  Breed: Lab mix  Approximate Age: 5 years Approximate Weight: 55 pounds Currently Living at: Mitzy is currently living in a D.C. foster home. Meet Mitzy! She is a Lab/American Staffordshire (AKA staffie) mix that weighs approximately 55 pounds. Mitzy has lived with older children and done wonderfully at adoption events with children under the age of 5. She's incredibly affectionate and loves to get snuggles from everyone! Since she can become overwhelmed with other dogs, so she would excel best as a single pup. Sadly, Mitzy found herself in a shelter after her owner faced unfortunate circumstances and lost his house. She is aching for a second chance and would love to find a new family that will love her forever! This sweetheart sometimes forgets about her size and thinks she is a lap dog as she tries to cuddle. She is also incredibly expressive and can make you laugh with her quirky smiles! She knows how to sit and take a treat, and has quickly learned down, paw and rollover. She will do anything for a treat! She loves to play tug of war with any toy (and leash!), and especially loves sporting goods (e.g., basketball). With a lot of love and a little patience, Mitzy will be the best new addition to your family! Like most shelter dogs, Mitzy may need a refresher on housetraining. She is likely crate trained. The fee for adoption of this dog is $350, which includes the cost of routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay/neuter. If you are interested in adopting, please download our Adoption Questionnaire and email it to Holly at HollyC@luckydoganimalrescue.org!

Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!  Seuss is a unique looking boy. Anyone remember the mullet? Business in the front, party in the back? Well Seuss, although not sporting a mullet still rolls with that same format. Dark, unassuming boy on the top, brindle and spotted babe on the bottom! And his face is a mixture of all of the above. His face almost has the coloring of a rottweiler. Anyways, he's handsome and a good boy that is well mannered inside and likes to let loose and have fun while outside. He adores balls and is especially fond of large ones that he can pop and carry around in his mouth. Boys will be boys. He takes treats nicely and seems to like other dogs, so bring your for a meet and greet if you decide to come and check him out. He will probably be fine with kids as he has a good middle of the road personality, but then again, bring them with you, the more the merrier while trying to see if he will be a good match to your family. Seuss is a bit timid in his kennel, but warms up nicely after being given a moment. So no judging his true personality by his quiet demeanor in the kennel. Please take a moment out of your day and share our boy or better yet come and visit him at Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 S Birdneck Road. He's hanging out in the large dog adoption room but if you bring the fur kids, then just ask for him up front and we'll be happy to bring him out to meet the family! Thanks for considering adoption!       Virginia Beach Animal Care & Adoption Center has wonderful pets available for adoption. As of December 6, all animals are now at the new shelter at 341 Birdneck Road. The former shelter on Leroy Drive is now closed. If you have lost a pet, please visit the shelter in person and often as lost animals arrive everyday.

03/19/2016	TX/JJ - Brittany (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Brittany	Curwensville, PA	Male	Posted Breed: Brittany (medium coat). JJ is a 7 year old orange and white neutered male Brittany boy who is looking for his forever home. His former owner could not take care of him and surrendered him to NBRAN. He is a big, healthy boy at 48# and is currently being fostered in TX. He is current on all of his immunizations and is microchipped.  JJ is a very loveable, obedient and intelligent boy. He is good with other dogs and with children. He is a moderate to high energy boy who loves to run. He will need a 6’ privacy fence and a large yard. JJ greets people enthusiastically, so his foster is working on his jumping on people when he greets them. He is pretty well-behaved other than that. He plays well with other dogs, but could be happy being an only dog as long as he gets attention from his people.  If you are interested in adopting JJ, please visit www.nbran.org and complete an adoption application before contacting Nancy Walker at nwalker@capecod.net. The cost to adopt JJ is $350.00 to offset his vetting and to allow NBRAN to rescue more of these wonderful pets.

03/19/2016	Chip - Dalmatian (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dalmatian	Temple, GA	Male	"Posted Breed: Dalmatian (short coat). ADOPT WITH PEACE OF MIND!   Most of our adoptable dogs are trained, socialized and ready to love your family. They have lived at our home-based boarding, training and rescue facility where we have worked to fully assess them so that we can help you make a perfect match with your new companion. For over 15 years, we have worked with owners and dogs with training and rehabilitation. We bring these skills to our rescue program to help you and/or your family find the perfect new dog that fits your lifestyle, activity level, home environment and personality. We pride ourselves on working closely with you to not only find the perfect dog, but to provide service and care for you and your new companion after adoption. The majority of our dogs receive formal training and we do several obedience lessons prior to adoption so that you and your new dog can learn to work together and, equally or more importantly, bond prior to going home. You can read more about our adoption process below this description of this incredible, adoptable dog! We also off adoptions for senior and special needs dogs, small breed dogs that do not require training for adoption (but that can be trained at the adopter's request), and our new HomeBuddies program, which is FREE and helps harder to place dogs find loving homes and includes training.  Our HomeBuddies adoptions will require strict screening and matching. These adoptions focus on dogs that are well-behaved and loving, but may have specific issues that have not responded to training. Some examples include socialization issues with other dogs or not being able to be around small children (not aggressive, but reactive to things like grabbing or quick jerky movements). These are loving dogs that deserve a chance at a forever home, but that will require special homes (i.e. no children, no other dogs, etc.). They each do include our 14 Day Off Leash Express program and the only expense is the cost of a remote collar that comes with the program (approx $200). ADOPTION FEES: Adoption with 28 Day OFF LEASH ULTIMATE TRAINING program $937.50 (dogs that will complete our full service training program normally priced $1749; includes 20% off boarding for life, private lessons for life, 24/7 support, remote training collar) Adoption with 14 Day OFF LEASH EXPRESS program $699.00 (dogs that will complete our full service training program normally priced $999; includes 20% off boarding for life, private lessons for life, 24/7 support, remote training collar) Small Breed without training (dogs under 30 pounds) $350 - fenced yard required Senior or Special Needs Adoptable $200 or negotiable based on dog and home (dogs 8+ yrs or dogs with special needs) Service Dog Candidates $450 (dogs leaving LILR and immediately entering service dog training; requires meeting with trainer) HOMEBUDDIES $FREE (INCLUDES our 14 day OFF LEASH EXPRESS program; difficult to place dogs that may have behavior issues that have not been responsive to training, but will still make great companions when matched with the right home; only expense is the cost of a remote training collar at $200) ***To find out which programs this dog is eligible for, please email info@lifeislabs.org as it varies with each dog, how long they've been with us and their general behavior and temperament. ALL ADOPTIONS INCLUDE: Full vaccinations, spay or neuter, parasite (fleat/tick/all worms) free, current on parasite prevention, microchipped, 20% off boarding for life at our facility. 24/7 access to us for anything you need related to your adopted dog.  FULL SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM ADOPTIONS ALSO INCLUDE: Unlimited private lessons for life and a remote collar. We do NOT do adoptions without our training program unless the dog is senior, special needs or a service dog candidate. OUR ADOPTION PROCESS 1.  Complete our adoption application. It usually takes our volunteers 1-2 business days to process your adoption application. 2.  Once your application is approved, set up a visit (by appointment please so that we can be available for you) to our facility to visit with the dogs that meet your preferences based on your application. You can visit more than once if you need more time to help choose a new companion. 3.  Once you select your companion, we may do a home visit. 4.  Complete an adoption contract. Dogs that are not receiving formal training can go home at this time. 5.  For dogs who have been trained, we typically have two-three visits/lessons, with the last being the day you take your new pup home. This timeframe and the lessons can vary by dog and adoptive individual and family. FOR ADOPTIONS RECEIVING OUR FULL SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM: THIS IS **NOT** your typical ""pet store"" or group class training. The result is a dog that you can enjoy in any setting and know that it's safe and a pleasure for everyone it visits with. You will be able to run, bike, hike, camp, garden and just plain relax with a dog that isn't going to run off or cause trouble. With the exception of seniors and special needs dogs, all of our adoptables receive either our ""28 Day Off Leash Ultimate"" or our ""14 Day Off Leash Express"" training program, which is available to the general public.  If you are adopting a puppy, they will go home with you and then come back around 6-8 months to complete their training. Our training program includes behavior training, socialization and obedience training. When dogs complete our program, they will walk with you both on leash and off, we have addressed any manners/behavior issues that would cause problems in their new homes and they will come when called reliably off leash. Some dogs do have lingering issues that we fully disclose -- the most common is dogs that can jump 4' fences (which is probably why they ended up in the shelter in the first place!).  When you come out for lessons, our typical lessons are: 1) leash walking, 2) gate and door manners, 3) coming when called to all family members and sitting upon arrival, 4) going for a walk off-leash with family and staying safely in the general area and returning immediately when called. Your new dog is ready to go home when we've completed the lessons and both you and we are confident and comfortable with your new pup's relationship and response to you and your family. Our adoptions with full service training include a dog that is:  Spayed or neutered Current on all vaccinations Clear of parasites (heartworm, flea, tick, worms, etc.) Current on all parasite prevention (heartworm and flea/tick prevention) Microchipped On a high-quality food (Merrick Whole Earth Farms) Fully assessed for temperament and behavior Crate trained Fully trained through our ""28 Day Off Leash"" (reg $1749) or ""14 Day Off Leash Express"" (reg $999) training program -- for dogs eligible for training  These adoptions also include:  Private lessons prior to adoption and UNLIMITED private lessons as needed once adoption is complete (for dogs that have completed training) 20% off boarding at any of our facilities for life Unlimited access to us for advice and assistance for ANYTHING you need in relationship to your adopted dog  The nature of our rescue program requires that dogs are with us typically 2-3 months from the time we take them into our program. During this time, they are living in and around our home with a variety of other dogs, cats, cows, people and general activity. We are assessing them 24/7 so that we know them very well and can confidently help you make the perfect match for a new companion. And we are training them daily (once they are happy and healthy) to prepare them for adoption. Payment arrangements can be made in the form of 50% down at the time of adoption and the remaining 50% in one month from that date. We understand that some people are shocked by this adoption fee. Please understand that this is NOT about making money. We care for 40 or more dogs in our program on a daily basis. All of our dogs are here typically 2-3 or more times longer than most rescues in other programs. We feed them high quality food, administer parasite prevention and provide food, toys, bedding, crates and a staff that helps care for them while we assess their behavior and temperament and conduct training. ALL of the proceeds from our adoptions go directly back to our rescue program. NONE of the adoption fee goes to us for training or boarding. Our adoption fee was set by taking a traditional adoption fee of $250 and then adding our commercial training program at half price (687.50 -- when it was originally $1375). We originally offered the training as an option. Almost every adopter did the training. The few that didn't were calling with behavior and training issues. We felt that there is a value to our training, both to the adopter, but even more importantly to the dog. We want our dogs to be LOVED and to become INSEPARABLE members of the family. We don't want them to cause stress or frustration. So in early 2011, we decided that all of our rescues would be trained. We hope that most people can see the value in the training and we encourage you to come out to visit and see the training in action if you are a potential adopter that's skeptical or on the fence. This is not traditional sit/stay training. This is training that will give you a well-balanced dog that is a pleasure 24/7. They are not little robots and they are not 100% without fault. But when you have a dog that you can travel with, hang out with, go to the mailbox with and that your friends and family can enjoy, we know that we've done our job by matching you with a dog that's a true companion and not just a pet... For more information, please email info@lifeislabs.org. PLEASE DO NOT CALL. Email is best for initial inquiries as it is difficult for us to spend time on the phone with all the work we have to do with the dogs. Thank you!                "
03/19/2016	Cookie - Obedience Trained! - Dalmatian / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Dalmatian-Unknown Mix	Jefferson, LA	Female	"Posted Breed: Dalmatian / Mixed. Cookie is an owner surrender. She is about a year old. She gets excited when people approach her kennel and loves attention. She had one litter of puppies prior to arrival to the shelter. She has been good with other dogs and is lovable and playful. Cookie graduated from a six week obedience training program provided by Canine Companions of LA. She lived with her trainers 24/7, was taught a variety of commands and was leash, crate, and house trained. She is currently in a temporary foster home while looking for a ""permanent"" foster or forever home. Cookie's temporary foster home reports that Cookie is perfectly housetrained & dances when she wants to go out. She loves all people and prefers to be with them, but is OK if they have to leave for awhile. She adores children and has expert experience sleeping with a 6 year old. Cookie also enjoys her meals lying down with her front paws around the bowl (preferably with a human near by) and a bin of toys where she can select the one she wants. She is a young & exuberant dog but responds well to direction. Looking for a conversationalist? Cookie is a “talker” who sounds like Chewbacca or Scooby-Doo, and who talks to tell you she wants to play, is hungry, or just needs loving. Cookie can be anxious in the shelter, and sometimes barks. At home, she only barks if a “dangerous” mailman knocks, or some “suspicious” cat walks by. Cookie likes to play with other dogs, but like any lady, prefers a proper introduction. She would also do best in a home with another dog around her size or larger. The adoption fee is $150. Fee includes at least one round of vaccinations, mandatory spay/neuter surgery, heartworm test, and microchip. If you are interested in adopting or fostering, please contact Cookie’s foster mom at lasins@cox.net or (504) 256-1111.                "

You see, I'm quite sad seeing as how I don't have my own home and a nice warm bed to snuggle up in. I am great with children, but I find cats tasty. Also, my ideal home would have a privacy fenced-in back yard because I know how to climb chain link. I'm a smart dog, so with a bit of training, I could be even more awesome!

03/19/2016	Cindy Lu Hoo D151713 - American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Eden Prairie, MN	Female	"Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). Name: Cindy Lu Hoo Date of Birth: Approx. 12/28/2012  Gender: Female Breed: Am Staff Weight: 57 Dog friendly: Needs very slow intros, does best as an only dog  Cat friendly: TBD Kid friendly: Yes House trained: Yes Crate trained: Seems to do fine left out Energy level: Moderate  History: Local stray  Adoption Fee: $200  From the Foster:      Cindy is literally the best trained dog I've had. She knows how to sit, shake, lay down, wait until I tell her she can eat her food, etc. she is great with little kids. Completely cared less about my neighbors 3 year old and just snuggled. She knows to go potty right away when we go outside. Overall, she is a super friendly dog with everyone.   She can get a little too interested in other dogs. I think with the right dog (male, calm, confident and totally not reactive) and slow enough intros she could make a friend, but without very careful monitoring and super slow introductions (this could take days or longer) it could easily turn into an aggressive reaction. For these reasons, I do think Cindy Lu Hoo will be best in a home without other animals.  She does have slight separation anxiety, she goes right in kennel if I tell her, but it's clear she's not a fan of not being with people. She has done fine left out, but I think she's not used to being inside for more than a 4-5 hour stretch - any longer than that she might have a potty accident. I think she'll get used that that with time, too.   Cindy Lu Hoo would make an amazing family pet for just about anyone.  She loves people, loves kids, and is basically coming to you fully trained and ready to just become your best friend.   All dogs are in individual foster homes throughout the Twin Cities.

Meet Brownie!!    As a City Official, I work with animal control often...they do their job and keep their head down, trying not to get emotionally involved or they would never be able to continue working. I had one officer that did an awesome job day in and day out. We did many rescues and wellness checks together, but there was only one time EVER she went out of her way to ask me to save a sweet dog and that baby was Brownie. Brownie was the victim of an animal abuse case where he was starved and mistreated. The officer has filed charges against its owner and carried this fragile animal to safety. Brownie had to stay at the animal shelter until the case went through trial. Daily she would see him and make sure he was cared for. Once that was over, this officer called and said ""I've never met a better dog who deserves a real chance at a loving home....can Proverbs please help?"" So I did make sure this baby was safe.  When it left the shelter, he was hairless and HW positive. Well after all it's health treatments, this baby is ready to to find its forever home full of love and tender kindness....because that is what Brownie is. Pure love, kindness. And tenderness. Brownie is a shar-pei around 5 years old. He loves people!!...and people love him. However Brownie prefers to be someone's one and only. We are in search of an exceptional home to provide the love that this sweet baby deserved its whole life. Come help us make up for Brownie's lost time...adopt him today!!                "

03/19/2016	Hank - German Shepherd Dog / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	German Shepherd Dog-Unknown Mix	Vacaville, CA	Male	"Posted Breed: German Shepherd Dog / Mixed (medium coat). Adopting A Shelter Dog These dogs come without background histories/ past medical information. We present these dogs as we have observed in relationship to age, size, breed, behavior, housebreaking, crate training, good with children, cats, dogs, and strangers. Dogs may present themselves differently in different environments, therefore The Dog Spot Rescue, their agents, volunteers, can not guarantee behavior, age, size expectations, breed, house Training, destructive behavior tendencies, and/or medical issues. All dogs from shelters have been subjected to pathogens from the shelter level which can materialize into disease in the future. Each adopter must observe for themselves pre-adoption and make decisions for themselves the suitability of said dog and their tolerance levels for transitional time when adopting a shelter dog. We ask that each adopter take their time when making the choice to bring home a rescued dog.Tortured,neglected but still he is a believer....   Hank was tortured by some cruel human who poured some sort of corrosive on his back which ate away his hair and several layers of skin. He was left to fester and die and ended up in a shelter and on the euthanasia list. A shelter volunteer called our rescue to ask for an 11th hour rescue and we answered the call. After spending months healing, we found that this dog was unfazed by what he had gone through and was still a ""believer.""He has given us nothing but love and attention and has the sweetest heart we have seen in a rescue dog. Always a smile, ready to hang out with a volunteer and has been nothing but kind to all around him. We feel that Hank deserves a second chance at life and love and hope that you agree with us. He will make an excellent soul mate dog. Does not dig, nor jump fences. Enjoys the company of people. He is nice to dogs but loves being with his person. Enjoys the beach, going camping, and taking adventure walks. ALthough his hair is still growing in, we think that it will be fully grown in soon. One ear has trapped blood and is bent over. Nothing to be done, it is from a trauma. Gives him character and he does not seem to mind it! Adoption is $250.00 which pays for his neuter, shots, rabies, chip, worming treatment, heartworm test (negative) bordetella and a two week post adoption trial period. If iterested in this soul mate dog, please fill out an on line application at: thedogspot.rescuegroups.org and then contact us at: thedogspotrescue@aol.com for a meet, greet and tail wag appointment. Hank is hoping for a happy ending to his sad story. A home and a heart to call his own.   Your Adoption Fee covers the following expenses: Spay/Neuter, DHLPP, Bordatella, Rabies (if age appropriate), De-worming and Frontline/Advantage Please Note: Shelter/rescue dogs have been exposed to many pathogens such as kennel cough, parasites, diseases and conditions some of which may not have been discovered prior to adoption. Any dog that shows symptoms here at TDS are routinely identified, taken for tests and treatment. Our vet bills can exceed $10,000 a month. However, without symptoms, we may miss a disease, or pre-existing condition or parasite. Consider carefully if you have the tolerance for these possibilities. We consider, you, the adopters, the last leg of the rescue process.                "

03/19/2016	Off-Site Foster 1511-0698 Star - American Pit Bull Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Virginia Beach, VA	Female	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier. Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!  A Star is born, right here at Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center! Waiting in the back room for someone to come and make her a part of their family sits a beautiful black and white pit mix named Star who would really like to be in a home for the new year! This 1 year old little girl is a barrel of monkeys and can't wait to get outside where she can run and play in the barn yard. She's as happy as any dog I've ever seen when she's in her element. Star did not stop smiling the whole time we were outside! So besides the fact that she is gorgeous, with the most amazing radar ears ever, Star also knows her basic commands and takes treats nicely. She's a bit of a puller on a leash, but she is young and with time and training that will lessen. Star seems to be fine with other dogs, so please bring yours to say hello so we can see how they will get along. She needs to be in a home with an active family that will help her burn her puppy energy up daily. I had a good time with her in the yard. She showed me no bad behaviors. She sat every time I asked her. She went potty as soon as she was outside. She ran like the wind every time a ball was thrown for her and smiled while flying through the air to get back to me! It really made my heart happy to watch! We played and snuggled and she was a typical one year old pup through it all. Even though she was a very good girl when out with me, she has been known to get mouthy when excited, so it would probably be best if she goes to a home without young children. Star is currently in foster care and doing wonderful. If you think you have a home that would be a good fit with our Star, please cal the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center at 757-385-4444 and we will get you in contact with her foster family. Thank you for considering adoption!  Virginia Beach Animal Care & Adoption Center has wonderful pets available for adoption.

Miley is a 1 year old purebred yellow lab. She likes other dogs and is very sweet and playful.   Miley's adoption fee is $150.The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.    Our adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!

03/19/2016	Bell - Chow Chow / Rottweiler / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Chow Chow-Rottweiler Mix	Boerne, TX	Female	Posted Breed: Chow Chow / Rottweiler / Mixed (medium coat). Bell was found laying on the side of the road after being hit by a car. Her angel brought her home and nursed her back to health and she was adopted out to a great family 2 years ago. Unknown to her rescuer, Bell is terrified of men. She was GREAT with the one year old little boy, GREAT with the 3 year old little girl and LOVED the lady of the house but after 2 years of never being comfortable with the man of the house, they had to return her and once again, Bell is looking for her forever home. The great home she had was mine, and this breaks my heart! I can tell you everything about this sweet doll, she lived with us for 2 years and while my husband was at work she was chill and relaxed, low energy, happy and so loving little girl but when my husband got home, she became a wreck. We worked with her and love her so much but the anxiety she feels from men isn't fair for her. I do think if she lived with a very calm natured, relaxed, quiet man that she would do well. My sweetie is boisterous, and it made her nervous. She is such a sweet girl, I can't say enough about her.

Dora is a sweet lovebug! Dora was adopted and recently returned due to some anxiety. She would probably do better with another dog to help her settle in and reduce her anxiety. She cannot live with cats but should do well with older kids. Her anxiety makes her quite vocal but with time and training it should diminish.

03/19/2016	Goldie - Labrador Retriever / Golden Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Golden Labrador	Princeton, MN	Female	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Golden Retriever / Mixed (medium coat). Hello humans!! I am currently on the hunt for a human or family of humans to call my own. You see I've had an interesting first 4 years of my life. But I choose to not think about where I have been, instead I am learning just how great my life will be! Right now I am truly a teenager. I have so much energy and my foster mom says I can jump like no other! Maybe they could have called me Tigger?! But all you have to say is kennel up and I know to go straight into my kennel!  I'm going to tell you a little more about myself. I know how to sit, and I'm working the other basic commands. Don't let my big sad brown eyes fool you! I'm a happy dog that loves attention and I love to walk outside! Everyday I am getting better and better on my lead. Although being a teenager I am distracted by just about everything, squirrels, rabbits, ducks, leaves. Vehicles scare me but I do love to ride in them. My foster mom thinks I might enjoy hunting if I had a good trainer. I'm kinda small for a Labrador mix but what I lack in size I make up for in love. Just so you know I also love a comfy couch, but hard wood is fine as well. I just like being by my human that saved me. I just don't want her to forget how much I appreciate her. I have met the other little humans here. They are awesome! I just want to lick them and let them lick me... But they just prefer petting me and rubbing my belly. I do have to admit there is one thing I'm taking my time on getting used to. They have a small version of me here, they call her Miss Ruby. She's noisy and really silly. I am kinda starting to like her. But I'm still afraid of her because I've never met anything like her before. Good thing she is patient with me. Oh and did I mention, I am completely potty trained!! My foster mom LOVES that part!! I guess the noisy one wasn't when she came to live here!  Well there you have it. I know I can be a bit windy but I figured you would want to know as much as you can about me!! I know my furever family is out there, I will be here waiting until you find me!

03/19/2016	AOIFE - Labrador Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Fernandina Beach, FL	Female	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed. Aoife (pronounced EE-fa) is one of our all-time favorites, a very sweet Labrador Retriever mix who will win your heart! She's about 4 years old and already spayed, and she's a beauty with a wonderful smile. She's housetrained and she walks well on her leash. She's affectionate and loves to be petted! She has a unique, lovely black-and-chocolate coat with white markings, and such a sweet face. She gets along very well with other dogs here at the shelter so we think she could be a great companion dog for you and your current pet -- please bring your family and other pets over for a meet-and-greet! She knows the sit, down, and paw commands. She also loves tummy rubs, cuddling, and giving kisses. Aoife is a dog with a story to tell -- she had a painful eye condition when she came to us, because she couldn't produce tears to keep her eyes moist. Her eyes needed attention throughout the day, and she never complained or resisted. We arranged for eye surgery and now the problem is gone! It was an intriguing solution -- some of her saliva is routed to her eyes now, so when she has a mouth-watering treat, her eyes receive that soothing moisture. One of our staff members has been fostering her, so please call ahead at (904) 321-1647 and set up an appointment to meet this truly wonderful dog. She's already spayed and ready to be your true love! Please watch her video, then come meet lovable Aoife!   The adoption fee helps in covering the medical treatment that has been completed. This includes the cost of the spay or neuter, testing for HW, HW preventative, rabies vaccination, wormings, annual vaccination, and flea and tick treatments.

Some of our pets are in a foster care home with a volunteer and if you wish to meet those pets an appointment will need to be made.

Baron - Male - 5 years old - GRRALL #0481 Hi! My name is Baron! Don't I have the prettiest smile? I'm searching for my forever family or person. Here's a little about me...l am a boy and a bout 5 years old. Most importantly, I'm a survivor! I was diagnosed with something bad called distemper, but I beat it and have no long-term side effects! I would enjoy being an only dog because I like getting all the attention I do get along well with other dogs, but I want to be the center of attention (who doesn't?). I even get along with my cat sibling! I would be a perfect fit for just about any domestic dynamic. I LOVE to play fetch and play with my toys. Will you consider adding me to your family? I'm such a unique guy and have a wonderful personality to go along with it! If you're interested in adopting me, please fill out an adoption application at www.grralliance.org/adopt                
03/19/2016	1507-0237 Dwight - American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Virginia Beach, VA	Male	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!  Dwight is a very special 2 or 3 year old pit mix boy. He's been with us since July and he really hoping to fine his forever home- shelter life is getting old. Dwight came in to us a hot mess. He had horrible skin that was just falling off and sore. He was skin and bones and terrified of people. Imagine a big bony dog that would sit and shake if you tried to talk to him. It has taken a while to get him to the point he is at now, but like I said, he's a special boy and he's worth the time invested. He has fans in both staff and volunteers that want him to find his perfect person so badly. He would probably do best in a home without small children as he is very skittish and hand shy. He will need someone with a slow hand and a warm heart to teach him that people are not to be feared. Honestly, Dwight reminds me of a dog that was kept in a crate while he was growing and never socialized. His paws are splayed and he is quite flat footed, again, like a dog that spent a lot of time in a crate. I would love nothing better than to see this boy go to a family that will love him and give him the time and understanding that he will need to become the wonderful dog that we know he is capable of being. Dwight is house trained and tried very hard to keep his kennel clean. He knows the sit command. He walks so well on a loose leash. Otherwise he doesn't seem to know much. He doesn't even appear to know what a toy is. He's got so much to learn and I hope the one thing he learns most quickly is that the world is his oyster and things can only go up from here! I can't wait until he realizes that toys are fun and people are wonderful to snuggle with! Dwight has came a long way since coming to us. He will go even further with the right person by his side. Dwight likes other dogs and loves being walked with them. Suddenly he comes to life, has a pep in his step, his tail doesn't stop wagging, and he smiles. If you think you may be the person that Dwight has been waiting for then please stop by Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 S Birdneck Road and ask a volunteer or staff member to bring Dwight out to meet you. You can ask for him by name or use his ID# 1507-0237.       Virginia Beach Animal Care & Adoption Center has wonderful pets available for adoption.

03/19/2016	1508-0413 Storm - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Virginia Beach, VA	Female	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!   Storm is a 1+ year old red head baby boy that sits in the back of his kennel scared to come forward to say hello, but if you meet him on the outside he is a marshmallow. He does seem to have a bit of fear of men, but once he's comfy with you he truly just wants to sit on your lap and love on you. Because of his fear of men, and things that are too fast and loud, he would probably do best in a home without small children. We want to set this boy up for success! Storm seems fine with other dogs! Please bring your resident dogs to meet him so we can be sure they want to be friends before you take him home. Once again, just trying to set the boy us for success. Storm appears to be house trained and knows his basic commands. He's good taking treats and enjoyed time in the barnyard. Come and ask to meet him outside his kennel to get a better idea of his true personality. Won’t you consider being his hero ? Please come meet this handsome boy soon at the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 South Birdneck Road. Feel free to go say hello to him in the large dog adoption room or ask for him up a the front by name and ID# 1508-0413 and we will be happy to bring him out to meet you.

03/19/2016	Alvin - Boxer / Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer-Unknown Mix	Potsdam, NY	Male	Posted Breed: Boxer / Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Alvin's ideal home will need to include a firm but patient owner who understands the concept of a tired dog is a happy dog. With a proper amount (lots) of both mental and physical exercise we believe he will make a fine pet for someone. Alvin was recently in a foster to adopt home with a cat and they unfortunately didn't become friends! So it looks like Alvin needs to be in a no cat home!                
03/19/2016	1509-1567 Sanjay - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Virginia Beach, VA	Male	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed. Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!Sanjay is AWESOME! He ended up at the shelter as a stray and was thought to be around 9 years old, although he acts a lot younger so its possible he is younger and has some premature greying going on. Sanjay is looking for an active family as he's not the couch potato kind of dog. He loves chasing balls, hiking, taking walks, and is an excellent running partner. He's pretty good on walks, although he does sometimes pull on the leash- he's a busy body and wants to meet everyone and investigate everything. Sanjay would love a family with a big fenced in back yard where he can run and chase squirrels. He would probably excel as a dockdog or in agility. Sanjay knows basic commands and is 100 percent house trained. He was recently neutered and spent a week living with one of his favorite volunteers. He was a perfect gentleman and got along wonderfully with their bossy female dog and all the neighborhood dogs he met. However, he did not do well with the family cat so he needs to go to a home with no feline members.  Sanjay is enthusiastic about everything, very intelligent and affectionate.  Please come visit Sanjay at the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 S Birdneck Rd, Virginia Beach, VA.

He is best suited as an ÂÂonly-dog child.ÂÂ A new loving forever home would be wonderful, but a temporary foster home until a permanent relocation can happen for his current owner is good too!                
03/19/2016	Jake - Adoption Pending - Rottweiler Dog For Adoption	rescue	Rottweiler	Golden Valley, MN	Male	Posted Breed: Rottweiler. A Rotta Love Plus is excited to be partnering with Best Friends Animal Society and Zappos.com in a 'Love is Priceless Black Friday to Cyber Monday' adoption event.  Thanks to Zappos.com for sponsoring the adoption fees for all adoptable ARLP program dogs, this coming weekend, your adoption fee is priceless!www.arottalove.org ** Please note that ARLP's regular adoption process will remain in place during this adoption event **  Meet Jake! He's looking for his forever home. If you are looking for a fun, goofy, intelligent boy for your next family - look no further!   Jake is one of seven dogs that came to ARLP from a neglect case in Indiana. He has come a long way in his foster home. Jake has learned that people are super cool, that crates are an ok place to hang out, and he has learned that riding in a car is actually great fun. It was a little scary at first - as it was a new experience for him. His foster dad worked with Jake to teach him to use a ramp getting into the tall truck. But, Jake is a quick learner - and treats helped a lot!   Jake's a smart boy and is enjoying going to training to polish up on his manners.  He is crate trained, leash trained, and knows his basic commands: sit, wait, come, etc.    Jake is currently living with another dog in his foster home, and has proven that he gets along well with other dogs. He loves to play around the yard or wrestle with his doggy friends.    Jake also loves to go camping with his foster family. He would be a good candidate for a family that likes to take trips to the cabin, or lake. He has met children, and would do best in a home with older, dog-saavy children.   If you think Jake would make a great addition to your home, please fill out an application today!

Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!This fat girl was with us once before, and she wasn't quite so full figured. Matter of fact she was ribs showing kind of thin and had just had pups. She stayed gone long enough to find her figure, or maybe I should say lose her waist. She's just as sweet and gorgeous as ever, only now there is a bit more of her to love! Solstice is a good girl that loves people of all shapes and sizes. She prefers to be the only dog in your family but she promises to be all the dog you will need! She is house trained and knows her basic commands. She loves water! Last time she was with us I had her in the kiddie pool and she really enjoyed herself. She's got an easy going personality that will no doubt be wonderful addition to the right family. Her past person says she always chews on her blanket to go to sleep at night. That breaks my heart. But enough of that, she's looking for a family that will keep her forever and always. A family that will be ok with only having one pet and that will put her on a pedestal like she deserves to be. No more baby making, back yard living days for this girl! If you are looking for a beautiful girl to add to your family then please take the time to come and visit Solstice soon at Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 S Birdneck Road.

Hershey is a handsome guy with a beautiful milk-chocolate coat... that's how he got his name! He was adopted from us about a year ago by an owner who loved him very much, but is being deployed, and Hershey couldn't go along. The owner said he's a loving dog and does great with people, including children. He doesn't do well with other animals, the owner said, so he probably should be the only pet in the home. The owner said he's house trained and knows how to sit, go down, walk on his leash and play fetch -- he really enjoys playing with tennis balls! He loves the water, too. He's about 4 years old and already neutered. He's intelligent and has ""radar ears"" that tell you when he's on alert. He also has a fantastic smile, especially when he closes his eyes with a look of sheer happiness! What would make him happiest of all is a forever home with you. Please watch his video, then come meet sweet, handsome Hershey very soon!   The adoption fee helps in covering the medical treatment that has been completed.

Because he was kept in confinement, he is not playful he doesn't know what to do with toys but he seems to really like having his belly scratched. He loves to go on walks. He has not shown a lot of personality yet and we think it's because he was not shown attention. he is slowly coming around and will wag his tail now when he see's us. He is very laid back.

Race Name: Kiowa Tell NewsTelly is a smallish boy who is just so handsome. He is outgoing and would do fine as a first or only greyhound.

03/19/2016	1506-1534 Gizmo - Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Virginia Beach, VA	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!Stunning 2 y.o. old big head!  Hunka hunka burning love is how I would describe  Gizmo with his big wrinkly head and muscular body. The only thing bigger than his muscles is his smile! This guy is as handsome as they come!  Gizmo is 2 1/2 years old and weighs 65 pounds. He came to us as an owner surrender when his owner's health declined and he was no longer able to care for this energetic boy. As far as young energetic dogs go this guy is not much different than the rest of them. He needs his daily exercise and continued training to help keep his manners in check. Gizmo walks well on a leash although if he spies a squirrel or hears some rustling in the bushes, he will totally stop and want to chase. It might take a little pull or two to get him back into the walk or run. He might show a little frustration when not allowed to chase that squirrel. This frustration will come out in biting at the leash. This is one behavior his new owner will have to work w/ him on. Other than that, he is pretty much perfect on the leash walking. Are you looking for a running partner? Well, Gizmo can also keep a good pace up for a few miles although his endurance might need some work. He does not like to be left in a yard by himself so plan on taking lots of walks or possibly runs w/ this big boy. Gizmo is house trained and crate trained. His previous owner said he has not been around cats but from what we have seen from him when around small critters, it's probably best he go to a home w/o cats. That being said, it's probably best he also go to a home as an only dog as well bc he has not been socialized so much w/ other dogs even though he came into the shelter w/ another dog. He is definitely proving to us at VBACAC that he is interested in other dogs and wants to be near them but he still needs work on his manners. He would benefit greatly from supervised play dates w/ other appropriate dogs; you can see how he is w/ one of his playmates in the videos below. The frustration behavior of biting the leash may also rear its head if you do not allow Gizmo to interact w/ another dog so this is why we are asking that Gizmo go to an experienced owner who can help him w/ this. Gizmo has one more behavior which needs some work, and thus an experienced owner, and that is his not letting go of toys or tennis balls. He has been known to eat toys and tennis balls which can be really bad for him so any toys he has must be hard enough to avoid him breaking and ingesting them. KONGS or solid kibble balls he can roll around but not tear, break or eat are perfect. Gizmo loves to go for car rides and loves meeting new people although he has a tendency to jump up in excitement. It's best he go to a home w/o small children bc of this jumping and the possibility of knocking little ones down. Gizmo also seems to love the water! If you are interested in a handsome young dog that has lots of energy and one of the best smiles around please come and meet him soon at Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 S Birdneck Road. Bring all of your family, dogs and older kids included to meet  Gizmo to see if your family and him will make a love connection. Please ask for him by name and ID# 1506-1534 and a staff member or volunteer will bring him out to meet you as he's currently in the back waiting for a spot on the adoption floor.       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLnrIrO6AnU&feature=you tu.be  Virginia Beach Animal Care & Adoption Center has wonderful pets available for adoption.

03/19/2016	Duke - Boxer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Jacksonville, AL	Male	Posted Breed: Boxer (short coat). Update on Duke: He is a super sweet love bug. He is great with kids and other dogs. He'll need a fenced in backyard and space to burn off his energy. He's a pretty big 2-3 yo . He's good loose in the house as long as you are with him, but he's too much of a puppy to stay uncrated while no one is home. Duke is a young, happy go-lucky boxer boy who has PLENTY of growing left to do. He is learning how to live in a house and is learning manners, but it's so hard to concentrate when those cats distract him! He is great with kids, but he'll probably do better with the 5+ crowd to start off with, unless he has a fur sibling to keep him busy. He is a very strong boy, and has picked up the bad habit of pulling, which we are working on. But on the plus side, he doesn't jump on people! This dog is being fostered near Athens, GA. YOU MUST BE WILLING TO DRIVE PART IF NOT ALL OF THE WAY TO PICK UP THIS DOG FOR ADOPTION. Please visit Rockin' P Rescue, Inc. to submit an online adoption application.

03/19/2016	Winston Chancellor Squishy Face - Bulldog (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Bulldog	Rochester, NY	Male	Posted Breed: Bulldog (medium coat). To adopt, the very first step is to fill out an application found on our website, where you can also read about our adoption process: www.wooftowndoggydaycare.com/adopt_a_dog.   OUR ADOPTION FEE IS $250 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTEDWinston Chancellor Squishy Face came into our rescue as a stray dog. We believe he is an olde english bulldog, he is approximately 65lbs, neutered and housetrained. He has some skin issues that are common with his breed.  He is a dominant boy, and will require an adult only home that has experience with Bulldogs.      We provide as much information on each animal's history, disposition and health as we can gather. Most of our dogs are from shelters and are strays, therfore we may not have any information at all on them, or what breed they are.  We strongly believe that honesty is the best policy. We want each of our animals to find the RIGHT home, not just ANY home. Likewise, we want you to find the pet who best matches your lifestyle and interests. You will first be required to complete our adoption application. Once received, a WT rep will contact you via phone or e-mail. If it seems you are a good fit for each other based on the info you provided, a phone interview will follow. If you are renting, we require proof that you are allowed to have a pet as well as any breed or size restrictions that may exist. If you have pets or did previously, we require your vet information and we will call them to verify that your pets are in good health, current on vaccines and spayed/neutered. We require that all pets in the home be spayed/neutered unless there are health reasons that can be verified with the vet. The final step is a home visit, where an WT volunteer comes to your home to verify your home is a safe place for an animal. It is also a time where the volunteer can answer questions and discuss safety precautions. In our Adoption Agreement, we require that every animal be spayed/neutered prior to adoption this means every dog that is adopted from us will be spayed/neutered prior to going to a forever home. This is VERY important as the overpopulation of dogs and cats in our country is a sad result of too many unplanned litters!  If for any reason the match is not as perfect as we all had hoped, the dog or cat must be returned to Wooftown, not given away or turned in to a shelter. Serious fines apply to violators of the Wooftown Agreement to Adopt. So be clear about what you are signing and be prepared to abide by the contract. It is legally binding and we take it very seriously.

03/19/2016	Bo - Boxer (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Woodbury, MN	Male	Posted Breed: Boxer (short coat). Hi my name is Bo, I’m a Boxer, maybe wth a little American Bulldog mixed in for good measure. My foster family calls me Bobo or Meathead ‘cuz my favorite snack is meat, and I have kind of a big head. I love car rides! Especially when I can ride in the front seat. My foster family takes me to this cool place, called a dog park, where I can run and play with other dogs. It’s great! Everyone is so nice to me and they have all the water you can drink. I like hanging out outside, sun bathing, sleeping on the couch and snuggling with you on the bed. I get along great with both of my foster fur siblings. I play chase and wrestle with my one year old boxer/hound fur sister. I really like it when my Foster Dad talks to me in silly voices, I wiggle and wriggle and do my happy dance. Sometimes I get scared; I don’t like thunder or gunfire even if it’s only on TV. If I get scared I shake, cower and run to hide I like to go at my own pace, I don’t like to be pulled or lead. I will tell you when I’m uncomfortable by pushing you away. I don’t like to be confined, and kennels are not for me. If I get nervous, sometimes I pass gas, sorry I can’t help it. I know my name, sit, come, shake, roll over and down. I’m working with my foster family on my manners: taking turns, waiting my turn and walking on a leash. I haven’t really been around little kids or other pets. I’m looking for a family who has the time and patience to help me conquer my fears so I can come out of my shell. Will you be my forever family?

Disco's fee has been sponsored and he has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and he tested negative for heartworms.  Disco is very cuddly and does well in a home with cats.

Visit us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/ShortnSweetRescueGerman Shepherd female approximately two years oldXena is a gorgeous appears to be pure bred German Shepherd. She is a very strong dog and needs an experienced owner. We believe she would like to kill and eat our cats, so we do not want to place her in a home with cats. She can be aggressive with people that act erratic, therefore we do not want to place her in a home with young children. She walks well on a leash as long as you insist upon it. She knows sit and so far that is her only command. She has been in the house and has not made a mess, but she does not live freely in the house so we do not know if she would maintain her good manners if that were the case.   This great dog is all ready for a new home!  The adoption donation of $200.00 pays for this dog's medical care & also contributes to the medical care needed by other dog's that come into our rescue. (some dogs need hundreds of dollars worth of care to make them adoptable) Why purchase a dog for hundreds of dollars (that still needs vaccinations & neutering & microchip) when you can get this darling dog that already has everything and help other dogs at the same time???  Every life is precious! Thank you for your support.Call us at 805 674-1236 to make an appointment to see our fosters.. 9:00am - 6:00 pm California time please!

Samantha is a sweet heart that lived with a loving foster family with 3 other dogs and cats. She is house trained and loves to be loved. Samantha has developed some fear and anxiety from shelter life and would benefit from an experienced foster or adopter who can help her see she is safe and loved. Rubenesque, a well fed chunky mama, her coat is lush and clean, her tail wags softly, her leash manners are good and she's likely housetrained. We have a lovely walk to the park, Samantha wagging her tail appropriately at other dogs we pass.  Posing for some pictures in the park she has her serious face on and sits when I ask her to. It's off leash in the backyard where she relaxes, playing with a squeaky toy, tossing it around happily smiling.  I discovered a secret about Samantha - if the toy doesn't squeak she's really not interested - give it a squeak and she lights up with playful glee! Super friendly and affectionate she lays her head in my lap as soon as I sit down, rolling into me for closeness and putting a paw on my knee. I love Samantha, she's gentle, playful, gorgeous, affectionate, sweet natured, just an all-around good girl who will make someone very happy. She's a doll, you'll love her when you meet her.

03/19/2016	Ollie - Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Labrador Retriever / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Austin, TX	Male	Posted Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler / Labrador Retriever / Mixed. Don't those ears look just like Batman's? Ollie certainly looks like the Caped Crusader. All he needs is his own Robin - namely a new owner to help him defend America.   His foster mom says this sweet boy is the biggest cuddler she's ever met. He's a big dog who thinks he's a lap dog who wants to snuggle with his people on the couch and in bed, giving kisses.   Ollie loves playing with other dogs, especially girls. He hasn't been observed with cats or kids, but he's extremely affectionate, so he should be a great companion for kids, at least.   This smart, obedient boy walks well on his leash and obeys the sit, stay and shake commands (and is working on more). He seems nicely house trained.   Ollie mostly just wants to be with his people, following right behind them, tail all awag. He's the first to greet his person when she comes home, hoping for some playtime, but just as happy to curl up on the couch.   Ollie will be the perfect fit into a home where his people can return his love, and maybe a family with another dog buddy to play with. Come visit and see if you can be his new Robin.   If you have questions, please email adopt@austinpetsalive.org.

Please contact Arizona Small Dog Rescue (www.azsmalldogs@gmail.com) for more information about this pet. Maverick is an absolutely gorgeous German/Belgium Shepard Mix who will turn 5 this year. Maverick is looking for a new home, but will need a very special family with extensive dog experience to handle this big boy. Maverick is looking to go to a family with no kids and no cats, and he would prefer to be the only dog and center of your attention. Maverick spent his early years being taught to protect his previous home/family; so while he will make the most loyal and loving companion, he will also become very possessive and protective of his home and the people he loves who reside there. Maverick is a very smart and well-mannered boy who walks beautifully on a leash, knows how to sit, shake, lay down, and roll over for belly rubs. Maverick knows the word “walk” and will get very happy to show you his leash and go patiently wait by the door while you finish tying your shoes. Due to Maverick’s protective tendencies we want him to feel very comfortable with his new family before leaving the shelter where he has made himself at home, so multiple meetings with Maverick will be required before adoption, and all members of the family must meet with Maverick before he goes home. Maverick is neutered, up to date on shots, microchipped, and will go home with 30 days of free pet insurance. To schedule a meet & greet with Maverick, or for any questions and other information you may want to know, call the shelter 7 days a week from 11am-6pm and talk to any of our adoption counselors who will be more than happy to assist in finding Maverick the perfect new forever family      WE ARE A CASH ONLY FACILITY     Tuesday - Saturday 10am to 5pm / 1102 W.

03/19/2016	Off-Site Foster 1412-1606 Chevy - Pit Bull Terrier / Boxer / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Bullboxer Pit	Virginia Beach, VA	Male	Posted Breed: Pit Bull Terrier / Boxer / Mixed (short coat). Thank you for your interest in our adoptable animals. If you would like more information about this pet, see the Shelter information below.  We would love to help you rescue a perfect pet!This 5+ year old handsome brindle pit/boxer boy has had more than his share of bad luck while looking for someone to give him their last name. At this point we want him to succeed and not come back to the shelter, so we are hoping that someone will step up with cat and (preferably) dog-free home. No kitties for this boy. He has a huge prey drive. Put him in the back yard and let him chase the butterflies or squirrels as they sit in the tree and taunt him, but no kitties. He is selective in his doggie friends as well, but he does okay with very calm, older dogs. A meet and greet would be necessary if you have a dog.  Now that we know what he doesn't need, how about what he has to bring to the table. Chevy is a happy boy that loves to run and play. He adores tennis balls. Adores them. He would be very happy to be able to chase them for a living. He is smart. He knows his commands. He loves hot dogs and you could probably train him to ride a unicycle with a pack of 99 cent hot dogs! He wants to be a good boy, he wants to learn how to walk on the leash without pulling. He wants to learn all the things that will make him admired and desired. He's been put through the ringer up to this point of his life, and he is looking for a true FOREVER family now. Chevy's previous family said he is house trained and likes kids. They had him for 3 years so I'd be willing to bet they know what they're talking about. Even better, he is 100% crate trained! Chevy is just a fun, happy boy looking for a cat-free family that will spend time playing fetch with him in the backyard and to give him belly rubs and snuggles. He likes everyone he meets and has a good balance between wanting to play and wanting to chill out with his peeps.   Chevy's profile picture says it all... LOVE. Chevy needs someone with love in their heart and space in their home to give a fella a place to lay his head while we find him the perfect forever family. We want to find this boy the home he deserves this time... the kind of home that he will grow old in and have people cry over him when he is gone. That's the kind of place we are looking for. Chevy deserves that kind of place.      If you are interested in meeting Chevy, please call the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption center at 757-385-4444 to set up a meeting. Ask for him by name and id #1411-0645    Virginia Beach Animal Care & Adoption Center has wonderful pets available for adoption.

03/19/2016	Laika - Husky / Shepherd / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Cabool, MO	Female	"Posted Breed: Husky / Shepherd / Mixed (short coat). Please contact Susan (ozarksummer@yahoo.com) for more information about this pet.PLEASE NOTE BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER: LAIKA IS NOT A STANDARD ISSUE CANINE, SHE HAS TENDENCIES THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL HANDLING. ITS THOUGHT SHE MAY HAVE SOME WILD CANINE IN HER FAMILY TREE AND SOMETIMES SHE DEFERS TO THOSE REACTIONS. SHE NEEDS SOMEONE WHO IS EXPERIENCED AND KIND TO HELP HER ALONG THE ROAD TO A HAPPY LIFE IN A FUREVER HOME. SHE HAS NOT BEEN WITH SMALL DOGS, CATS OR KIDS. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Laika meets strangers with some confidence, not tons...........pictures dont show how truly eloquent she is in her structure and style. She LOVES to go on a leash walk and will sit on command. She prefers men over women and would like a dog to play with who wont be scared of her or mean to her! She actually sits and holds her chin up to get her leash put on! She loves to sniff and snuffle around on her walks!  ************************************************* Laika is a very special girl. While she desires human companionship and the indoor living she has learned to love, she has a primal part of her that says ""stand alone and flourish"". We cant help but wonder if this beautiful dog isnt the result of a common population clash we experience here in the ozarks when unaltered farm dogs and wild canines of the Ozark Forest meet and the resulting youngsters hearts are tainted with the call of the wild.  Laika is very smart and cunning and walks beautifully on a leash and has a mind that is constantly absorbing. She has an exceptional gift to reason which is not common in canines. She loathes the confinement of the shelter and responds well to familiar humans, looking deep into their eyes as if reading their soul~~~this dog needs a special place to see her future. It is partially that ""Northern thang"" we respect so much but something else as well.  Laika has shown us that she had a very domineering male human she shared indoor living with and he was strong and severe in his training and expectations. Perhaps the only way he knew to temper that untamed part of her true spirit. She has many common basic training skills. Dogs whose ethos is divided between indiginous urnings and domestic urnings are tormented. Strong desires and instincts pulling them in every direction leaving them unsure of which way to go and what to trust. A situation that could be easily avoided by SPAYING female dogs!!! Once you have earned their trust they are the most loyal of canines. She will become the beta to her alpha and would lay down her life without a second thought. We now search for that alpha.......the alpha we seek is kind, never violent, strong, persistent and consistent. Respectful of that wild side but never indulgent of it, therefore a enclosure is a must. An enclosure with access to the home required.  Laika is about 40 lbs.   NO CATS!!!!                "

Apollo NKA Harry is very healthy and happy, and loves to give kisses to everyone.   He has no medical issues but has been doing well on a very low dose of Temaril P for itching/allergies.   Routine vaccines are up to date and he receives monthly heartworm/flea preventive.   Apollo NKA Harry likes other dogs, but can have a tendency for resource guarding toys and bones, so he would either need training for that or just not be given toys/bones.

Apollo NKA Harry is great at fetch and will run far distances to bring the ball back.   He loves to swim out to retrieve, too, or just to play with humans in the water.

He adores cuddling on the couch with his foster parents or his foster brothers and enjoys playing with his siblings too. He loved all the children he met at his first adoption event,. He hasn't met a cat yet, but I have no doubt he'll think they're super cool too. He's an absolute doll and whoever gets him is one lucky family. 10/28/12 Apollo is a 4 month old, white, Pit Bull terrier mix. He was rescued from Centralia Illinois Animal Control. When we first got Apollo he became very sick with parvo. He was rushed to Horseshoe Animal Hospital. He is now a happy and active puppy. Sue did some pictures of this adorable boy, he is so sweet.

03/19/2016	Iggy - Alaskan Malamute / German Shepherd Dog / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Alaskan Malamute-German Shepherd Dog Mix	Edmond, OK	Male	"Posted Breed: Alaskan Malamute / German Shepherd Dog / Mixed (medium coat). Adoption fee is $100, this dog is approx. almost 4 yrs old and is about 85 pounds  He is a fun goofy lug and knows some basic commands and housetrained. He is full of energy and will need a lot of exercise and attention and another dog to play with to keep him content. He is a known escape artist and he originally had some food aggression with other dogs but not humans but is getting much better eating around the other dogs, but if the other dogs are small we suggest feeding separately for safety for the small animal.   Iggy does need another dog in his home to keep him company while his family is away. He will also need a hot wire to keep him contained. This info is based on known history on this dog and is needed for a successful adoption.  All of our Husky/Northern breeds require a home visit for us to check out the fence and give tips on containment if needed. You can quicken your adoption process by sending us some yard pics, focusing on the fence lines after you send your application. Please keep in mind if you want to own a husky you need to be willing to install a hot wire system (cost approx $100) this is quite often needed to preventing digging climbing or chewing through fences. A Hot wire is typically the best route to start with for a piece of mind. Some of our dogs we will require this prior to adoption due to known escape habits or the type of fencing you have. Installation is simple and can be done in under 2 hours on most yards. Northern breeds are beautiful dogs but are also a challenge and demanding and can be very destructive and hard to contain when there needs are not met. Please learn a little more about the breed on our home page. Also we likely have other Huskies or Malamutes for adoption find out by visiting www.petangelsrescue.org. The adoption fee is $150. This dog has had its age appropriate Vaccinations brought up to date with Rabies shot (4 m & older), heartworm tested (4 m & older) and/or started on prevention, basic dewormer, spayed or neutered and microchipped by 24Petwatch with free registration , and also comes with 30 days of free 24Petwatch Pet Insurance .

I been through obedience classes and was told I did a great job and seem to remember everything I was taught. I am in doggy daycare every day and love playing with my doggy friends. So if anyone out there needs a playful brother I am here for you. Adoption Fee: $390.00We are a Wisconsin state licensed dog rescue -WI# 402433   ***We do not have a central adoption center at this time. All our dogs are in private foster homes within WI. At this time we only place our dogs in areas of WI. The breed of our dogs is our best guess with the help of our veterinarians.  Our Weight Classes are as follows: 0- 25lbs - Small 26- 45lbs - Medium 46-89 - Large 90+ X-large If you are adopting an adult dog, which we consider 6 months of age or older, your adoption fee includes the following:  Spay/Neuter, Rabies and Distemper shots, dewormed, flea & tick preventative, heartworm tested and microchipped.  If you are adopting a dog younger than 6 months of age, the dog will be up to date on the shots as per the dogs age. The dog will be dewormed, flea/tick preventative and microchipped. We only spay/neuter our dogs by 6 months of age. If you decide to adopt a younger dog than 6 months of age, they will need to be spayed/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This will be determined by your contract along with the month they should have their surgery. This is included in your adoption fee.  Once you are approved with our rescue, you can meet any one of our dogs within the fosters home. If you are interested in the dog you met, you can take the dog home under our mandatory foster to adopt program. You receive 5 days to see if the dog is the right fit for your home.  If it is, we will conduct the home visit and finalize adoption. If it is not, it is returned to the foster. We are happy to find you another dog that meets your needs in your home.  If a dog is listed as PENDING, a family has met the dog and planning on adopting the dog after the home visit has been conducted. We always suggest sending in an application for a dog because there are times where the dogs are given back to us under the foster to adopt program. There are many reasons dogs are returned but normally it just was not the right fit for all.Please go to WWW.TAILWAGGERS911.COM under HOW TO ADOPT . We have an online application that is very easy to fill out.                
03/19/2016	Spook - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Temple, GA	Male	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Hi! I'm Spook. Sometimes they call me Pookie. I came with the name Spook because I used to be scared of everything... And for good reason! I got a pretty rough start. I came from a horrible shelter, which was bad enough. But then something got stuck in my lungs when the doctor's were neutering me. They had to get that out of me. Then my tail got chopped off in a door where I was staying. And if all that wasn't enough, my leg got stuck somewhere and all the skin came off. The group that was keeping me got in big trouble and me and all the other dogs had to leave. I was so happy when I was brought here! I was nervous at first. Things hadn't gone really well for me so far. But I received lots of love and care. And everyone was friendly. I also noticed that things didn't seem dangerous here. I had soft places to lay and lots of area to run and play. After a while, I realized I was in a really great, safe place. I was making new friends and things weren't so scary anymore. I feel very confident now and I love meeting new people and friends. I play with everyone. I do like to have my own toys, though, but I let my friends know when I want to be left alone with my them. I sleep in my crate at night and I'm very peaceful and comfortable. During the day, I'm really good about letting them know when someone arrives, but I do not bark all the time and I always stop when they tell me. As you can see in my pictures, I love to run and play. I'm happy all the time and life is just great. I'm also really good in the house. I stayed here as a housedog for a long time because of all that happened to me. They knew I needed extra special care. Even though all the dogs get house time, I got extra housetime because I was in bad shape and really worried. I'm good now and I'm ready to go to my forever home! Is it with you and your family? I promise to be a sweet boy and faithful companion! ADOPT WITH PEACE OF MIND!   Most of our adoptable dogs are trained, socialized and ready to love your family. They have lived at our home-based boarding, training and rescue facility where we have worked to fully assess them so that we can help you make a perfect match with your new companion. For over 15 years, we have worked with owners and dogs with training and rehabilitation. We bring these skills to our rescue program to help you and/or your family find the perfect new dog that fits your lifestyle, activity level, home environment and personality. We pride ourselves on working closely with you to not only find the perfect dog, but to provide service and care for you and your new companion after adoption. The majority of our dogs receive formal training and we do several obedience lessons prior to adoption so that you and your new dog can learn to work together and, equally or more importantly, bond prior to going home. You can read more about our adoption process below this description of this incredible, adoptable dog! We also off adoptions for senior and special needs dogs, small breed dogs that do not require training for adoption (but that can be trained at the adopter's request), and our new HomeBuddies program, which is FREE and helps harder to place dogs find loving homes and includes training.  Our HomeBuddies adoptions will require strict screening and matching. These adoptions focus on dogs that are well-behaved and loving, but may have specific issues that have not responded to training. Some examples include socialization issues with other dogs or not being able to be around small children (not aggressive, but reactive to things like grabbing or quick jerky movements). These are loving dogs that deserve a chance at a forever home, but that will require special homes (i.e. no children, no other dogs, etc.). They each do include our 14 Day Off Leash Express program and the only expense is the cost of a remote collar that comes with the program (approx $200). ADOPTION FEES: Adoption with 28 Day OFF LEASH ULTIMATE TRAINING program $937.50 (dogs that will complete our full service training program normally priced $1749; includes 20% off boarding for life, private lessons for life, 24/7 support, remote training collar) Adoption with 14 Day OFF LEASH EXPRESS program $699.00 (dogs that will complete our full service training program normally priced $999; includes 20% off boarding for life, private lessons for life, 24/7 support, remote training collar) Small Breed without training (dogs under 30 pounds) $350 - fenced yard required Senior or Special Needs Adoptable $200 or negotiable based on dog and home (dogs 8+ yrs or dogs with special needs) Service Dog Candidates $450 (dogs leaving LILR and immediately entering service dog training; requires meeting with trainer) HOMEBUDDIES $FREE (INCLUDES our 14 day OFF LEASH EXPRESS program; difficult to place dogs that may have behavior issues that have not been responsive to training, but will still make great companions when matched with the right home; only expense is the cost of a remote training collar at $200) ***To find out which programs this dog is eligible for, please email info@lifeislabs.org as it varies with each dog, how long they've been with us and their general behavior and temperament. ALL ADOPTIONS INCLUDE: Full vaccinations, spay or neuter, parasite (fleat/tick/all worms) free, current on parasite prevention, microchipped, 20% off boarding for life at our facility. 24/7 access to us for anything you need related to your adopted dog.  FULL SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM ADOPTIONS ALSO INCLUDE: Unlimited private lessons for life and a remote collar. We do NOT do adoptions without our training program unless the dog is senior, special needs or a service dog candidate. OUR ADOPTION PROCESS 1.  Complete our adoption application. It usually takes our volunteers 1-2 business days to process your adoption application. 2.  Once your application is approved, set up a visit (by appointment please so that we can be available for you) to our facility to visit with the dogs that meet your preferences based on your application. You can visit more than once if you need more time to help choose a new companion. 3.  Once you select your companion, we may do a home visit. 4.  Complete an adoption contract. Dogs that are not receiving formal training can go home at this time. 5.  For dogs who have been trained, we typically have two-three visits/lessons, with the last being the day you take your new pup home. This timeframe and the lessons can vary by dog and adoptive individual and family. FOR ADOPTIONS RECEIVING OUR FULL SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM: THIS IS **NOT** your typical ""pet store"" or group class training. The result is a dog that you can enjoy in any setting and know that it's safe and a pleasure for everyone it visits with. You will be able to run, bike, hike, camp, garden and just plain relax with a dog that isn't going to run off or cause trouble. With the exception of seniors and special needs dogs, all of our adoptables receive either our ""28 Day Off Leash Ultimate"" or our ""14 Day Off Leash Express"" training program, which is available to the general public.  If you are adopting a puppy, they will go home with you and then come back around 6-8 months to complete their training. Our training program includes behavior training, socialization and obedience training. When dogs complete our program, they will walk with you both on leash and off, we have addressed any manners/behavior issues that would cause problems in their new homes and they will come when called reliably off leash. Some dogs do have lingering issues that we fully disclose -- the most common is dogs that can jump 4' fences (which is probably why they ended up in the shelter in the first place!).  When you come out for lessons, our typical lessons are: 1) leash walking, 2) gate and door manners, 3) coming when called to all family members and sitting upon arrival, 4) going for a walk off-leash with family and staying safely in the general area and returning immediately when called. Your new dog is ready to go home when we've completed the lessons and both you and we are confident and comfortable with your new pup's relationship and response to you and your family. Our adoptions with full service training include a dog that is:  Spayed or neutered Current on all vaccinations Clear of parasites (heartworm, flea, tick, worms, etc.) Current on all parasite prevention (heartworm and flea/tick prevention) Microchipped On a high-quality food (Merrick Whole Earth Farms) Fully assessed for temperament and behavior Crate trained Fully trained through our ""28 Day Off Leash"" (reg $1749) or ""14 Day Off Leash Express"" (reg $999) training program -- for dogs eligible for training  These adoptions also include:  Private lessons prior to adoption and UNLIMITED private lessons as needed once adoption is complete (for dogs that have completed training) 20% off boarding at any of our facilities for life Unlimited access to us for advice and assistance for ANYTHING you need in relationship to your adopted dog  The nature of our rescue program requires that dogs are with us typically 2-3 months from the time we take them into our program. During this time, they are living in and around our home with a variety of other dogs, cats, cows, people and general activity. We are assessing them 24/7 so that we know them very well and can confidently help you make the perfect match for a new companion. And we are training them daily (once they are happy and healthy) to prepare them for adoption. Payment arrangements can be made in the form of 50% down at the time of adoption and the remaining 50% in one month from that date. We understand that some people are shocked by this adoption fee. Please understand that this is NOT about making money. We care for 40 or more dogs in our program on a daily basis. All of our dogs are here typically 2-3 or more times longer than most rescues in other programs. We feed them high quality food, administer parasite prevention and provide food, toys, bedding, crates and a staff that helps care for them while we assess their behavior and temperament and conduct training. ALL of the proceeds from our adoptions go directly back to our rescue program. NONE of the adoption fee goes to us for training or boarding. Our adoption fee was set by taking a traditional adoption fee of $250 and then adding our commercial training program at half price (687.50 -- when it was originally $1375). We originally offered the training as an option. Almost every adopter did the training. The few that didn't were calling with behavior and training issues. We felt that there is a value to our training, both to the adopter, but even more importantly to the dog. We want our dogs to be LOVED and to become INSEPARABLE members of the family. We don't want them to cause stress or frustration. So in early 2011, we decided that all of our rescues would be trained. We hope that most people can see the value in the training and we encourage you to come out to visit and see the training in action if you are a potential adopter that's skeptical or on the fence. This is not traditional sit/stay training. This is training that will give you a well-balanced dog that is a pleasure 24/7. They are not little robots and they are not 100% without fault. But when you have a dog that you can travel with, hang out with, go to the mailbox with and that your friends and family can enjoy, we know that we've done our job by matching you with a dog that's a true companion and not just a pet... For more information, please email info@lifeislabs.org. PLEASE DO NOT CALL. Email is best for initial inquiries as it is difficult for us to spend time on the phone with all the work we have to do with the dogs. Thank you!                "

03/19/2016	Maggie (fka Cinnamon) D122208 - American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier-Unknown Mix	Eden Prairie, MN	Female	"Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Name: Cinnamon (Now goes by Maggie!)  Age: Date of Birth: 08/29/2012 Gender: Female Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier mix Weight: 41 pounds Dog friendly: Very Selective, might be best as only dog. Cat friendly: No Kid friendly: Yes House trained: Yes Crate trained: Yes Energy level: Medium History: Local dog from Minneapolis Animal Care & Control Adoption Fee: $200  From the Foster:  Swimming, jogging, playing fetch, going for road trips, hanging out on the patio... I am your ultimate summertime pal! I love EVERYONE that I meet, small and tall, greeting Humans with a wiggly butt and a loving rub with my head. Because I'm a friendly gal, everyone is pretty glad to meet me, too. I am happily affectionate with my Foster Humans, rubbing them with my nose and head, looking for cuddles and belly rubs and butt scratches whenever I can get them. My three Kids have treated me very well- giving me daily walks, playing fetch with me in the yard, snuggling in front of the heater vents on cold winter mornings... everything a doggy could ask for. I have great doggy manners, waiting nicely at the back door before coming inside, sitting patiently as my food bowl is filled and set down, and letting my Foster Humans move through doors first when they say ""excuse me"". I'm so smart and I learn so quick, I just can't wait for you to teach me how to be the BESTDOGEVER for your family.      Although it takes me a while to adjust to close quarters with other dogs, I can be a good sister dog to mellow dogs that know how to calmly remind me of my place in the family (like my sister-dog in my Foster Family). I would likely do best with a more mellow male friend, but would be fine being an only doggie, too.  I don't like to be approached loudly by dogs I've never met when I'm out walking, but with patient, persistent guidance I can learn to enjoy meeting new doggy-friends. It's better if I live in a dog-only house, though, because I find kitties SO VERY EXCITING that I can't even think straight when they are in my sight.     I'm so happy to sleep in my kennel at night... it's my very own snuggle space. I enjoy fuzzy little blankets to cuddle up on during chilly weather, and am especially happy curled up in the laps of my Foster Humans. I know exactly where doggies go potty - outside - and have never had an accident in my house. I know that dog toys are for me and people things are for my Humans, so you won't find me chewing shoes or wrestling furniture. When you have to go out during the day, I get very excited to go in my kennel and have a Kong toy with a small cookie inside to keep me busy. Of course, I'm ever so happy to greet you when you come home again!     Maggie Fun Fact: I *love* doggy sweaters and coats... I look so cute dressed for my winter walks!

Please contact Sherrie (ladiblade2@sbcglobal.net) for more information about this pet.  Email T.A.R.A. | T.A.R.A.'s Web Site | On-Line Application     Polly is a sweet natured girl who is cautious and timid in new environments and around new people. It doesn't take her long to warm up though and then, she just wants to be your best friend. She has lived with an 18-month old child and, while she does well with children, she does get a little spooked during loud chaotic play, so older children with good manners around her are a must. She also needs to have at least one doggy sibling that she can bond with and to be her leader. She will display separation anxiety (whining, pacing, not eating well) without one, but is completely fine if there's another dog to be her buddy. She loves Kong toys and tennis balls. She does well in a crate, but isn't particularly fond of getting into it yet. She is house trained and has not displayed any destructive behaviors. If you are able to give Polly the home she needs and deserves, fill out a non-binding online application to meet her. Once you meet her, she will instantly grab your heart!     Approximate Birthdate:  10/31/12     Adoption Fee: $150.00    TARA's adoption fee includes: spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and prevention (if age appropriate), flea prevention, and deworming. TARA's pets are all eligible for a  two week trial  .   Due to the fact that many of our dogs come from the local city shelters, we do not know the background of many of them and therefore cannot always guarantee age or breed.

03/19/2016	Baby Bradley - Terrier / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Washington, DC	Male	Posted Breed: Terrier / Mixed (short coat). Please contact Stephanie Rivero (stephanier@luckydoganimalrescue.org) for more information about this pet.This sweet boy needs a home!BABY BRADLEY NEEDS A FOREVER HOME!!!! If you are viewing BABY BRADLEY's bio on petfinder, please click below for more information! Name: Baby Bradley  Breed: Terrier Mix Approximate Age: 2 years old Approximate Weight: 70 lbs Currently Living at: Foster in the DC Metro area Has lived with: Kids and cats, he gets along with most dogs. Special Adoption Considerations: Baby Bradley is a resource guarder- he will need to go to a home with an experienced owner who will take him to obedience classes.   Hi there! My name is Baby Bradley and let me tell you- I’ve already had quite the life. I was adopted as a young pup but due to some unfortunate circumstances am now looking for a new home. I'm waiting every day for my chance to find someone to love, cuddle, and play with!    So a bit about me: I've got a really beautiful and soft black and white coat and big floppy ears- that will do whatever you tell them to (with some proper training, that is)! Right now, I’m about 2 years old and 70 lovable pounds. My age means that I am likely done growing—but no matter how big I get I’ll always think of myself as a lap dog.    I do really well with most dogs, I am interested in cats but can get along with them, and I do OK with kids that are older than 15.    I’ve been daydreaming everyday about my new family, and I've decided I would love to go to a home with some folks that will take me on trips to the dog park to play with my canine friends. I don’t think I would be able to stop wagging my tail if I had my very own human who will give me lots of belly rubs and get me cool toys to play with. If my new family would take me to obedience classes so that I could use my smarts to learn tons of new tricks that would be amazing. If you think I might be the right dog for you, then please let my adoptions coordinator know! I do hope to hear from you soon!   Woofs and tail wags,    Baby Bradley     The adoption fee for this dog is $350, which includes the cost of routine vetting, including vaccinations.

Princess is:  - Housebroken, crate trained and rides well in the car  - good with children       - She is highly intelligent, learns very quickly and has a high desire to work          - Princess' leash manners have improved significantly and she is learning to behave like a lady in public.              - Not good with cats  -          Princess is a strong dog and requires daily exercise to channel all that energy into positive outlets. She would be very successful in an active household with owners who are willing to provide her with daily exercise.  Please consider this adorable dog as a lifelong friend.

She is happy to cuddle on the couch, but she also loves to go on walks, hikes or runs.  When Fallyn looks at you, you can see how intelligent and affectionate she is. She makes an instant connection with almost everyone she meets.   Above all, Fallyn is a happy dog. Whether she is greeting you in the morning or going into her crate at night, Fallyn bounces across the room like she has never had so much fun in her life.   Fallyn would love to have a family of her own and would make a wonderful addition to almost any family.                
03/19/2016	Gigi - American Pit Bull Terrier Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Bakersfield, CA	Female	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier. Meet Gigi a gorgeous, nearly two year old Pit Bull Terrier. Gigi was rescued from the streets in a horrible part of town. She was homeless and she is a survivor! She was even found one morning sleeping in a school bus to stay warm. This poor dog had a rough life but is on the way to a better one. Gigi is extremely people friendly. She will lick you to death, roll over for endless belly rubs and stay huddled in your lap for hours. She will make a true and loyal companion. Gigi is very particular about her playmates and we would recommend a single pet household. Gigi and cats cannot live under the same roof. However her tempermant as the only one is superb. Gigi is up to date on shots, microchipped and spayed. Her adoption fee is $200 and that will help to save another dog that is in the shelter or on the streets. As with all of our pitbull adoptions a home visit is required!

03/19/2016	Rizzo - Siberian Husky (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Siberian Husky	Cabool, MO	Male	Posted Breed: Siberian Husky (medium coat). Please contact Susan (ozarksummer@yahoo.com) for more information about this pet.PLEASE NOTE BEFORE INQUIRING- Rizzo is not a carefree kid, he has suffered the most unmentionable type of abuse ever and would need lots of emotional support and would need to be worked with a lot. He has never been around small dogs or children and I sure wouldn't trust him loose at all.He really needs a home with a rehabber or trainer or something like that, to deal with his psychological needs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Anyone to be considered for Rizzo would need to be a calm, firm, experienced with Northern breeds and willing to learn about dogs that have suffered extreme abuse. Must be fenced but cannot be confined in small areas. The nature of his abuse is not something we can put on a public forum but believe me, its hideous and extreme. He is doing well with skilled foster care and the next move needs to be in that therapeutic direction as well. ****************************************** Rizzo is doing fabulous, he is running and playing and loving just being a dog. He has lost his fear of someone touching his collar and will now come when called. He still tends to pull on the leash when walking but he loves to go for walks but that was put there by Mother Nature. He has gained weight and is now up to 60 pounds. He has the cutest looking delicate paws and the sweetest brown eyes you have ever seen. He is agile and fast and would make someone a great dog to play with. He does still flinch once in awhile if you reach for him quickly but is much more trusting now of everyone. He loves his treats and toys and is just a happy, playful boy now. He loves to be hugged and petted which is a huge step for him because at first he would pull away if you tried to hug him but now he will snuggle up to you to be loved on. The change in him is remarkable, with just some love and regular food and water he has become the great boy he was meant to be. Rizzo would do great in a home with another large female dog that likes to play. He loves playing with his foster sister.He must have a secure fenced yard!! The abuse this boy survived in his young life is a crime and he has overcome so much. Now he just needs a new family that understands and will nurture him and allow him to continue to thrive!Housetraining initiated but follow up will be required. Dog with abuse backgrounds often take longer as they need gentle persuasion and not discipline to get the message. Foster mom can sure update us on that if an interested adoptor comes along.Rizzo has made such huge strides since he came to us skinny, scared, and abused.He has found out that being cared for and getting hugs and ear scratches is just a pretty neat thing now. He is happy so see you, tail wagging, smiling face, ready for some love and attention.......favorite thing is to have the base of his tail scratched. He will look at you with those beautiful brown eyes and raise his paw as if to say....I love you come on and give me some ear and tail scratching. Proper introduction will be necessary for Rizzo success as he still bears a few emotional scars from his ordeal. Born approximately 2006.                
03/19/2016	Eve - Mountain Cur / Hound (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mountain Cur	Cabool, MO	Female	Posted Breed: Mountain Cur / Hound (short coat). Please contact Susan (ozarksummer@yahoo.com) for more information about this pet.Approaching her golden years without a home in sight.......Eve continues to be afraid of thunder storms and would need a quiet home with a fenced yard, indoor outdoor with a doggy door and a few doggy buddies would be great. Most of all she needs a low key loving home where she can have some loving support on those stormy nights! ********************************* Spring update on sweet Eve.........Eve is a friendly wants to please and wants to stay with you girl. On walks she sticks right by you, wants to be where you are and is content to just hang out and be part of a family, she needs one of her own that she knows will be permanent forever no matter what. Does fairly good on leash, pulls some but listens well when verbally reminded. Super loving and playful. House broken with dog door. Eve is scared of bad thunderous weather and should not be considered as an outside only dog.Eve is available for a donation of $125, she is altered and current on shots and worming.   Eve is housebroken and uses a doggy door, loves rawhide bones. Is doing really good on leash, still pulls some but does very good overall. Gets along great with other dogs large or small. She is a beautiful graceful feminine girl, she is grace in motion when she runs. Probably inching up to 50 lbs at this point.Original: Eve was abandon in a pen behind the house where her owners used to live. She was growing thin and weak. Thank God it was not August! She currently weighs 38 pounds, is still on the slim side but she is also delicate in stature, small boned and about 24 inches to the top of her shoulder. Her tail is short but has a couple of crooks in it like it has been broken or something. Maybe her mother nibbled it at birth or she had a very bad dock job, we will never know. She has a very unique bark, the music of a hounds bay but shorter and clearer. Now that she is growing used to food she is very animated, energetic and fun. Eve prances around like a show horse, she ran circles and pranced and jumped in sheer thankfulness to be saved. She is red with a white chest and the white streak down her face. She isn't super young but definitely not old acting at all. Maybe around 3-4 years old (just a guess). She is graceful and agile when she runs and jumps and her front feet do prance like a horse when she is running and walking. She is really pretty, on the small side, delicate, feminine but strong and smart.

03/19/2016	Archie *NEW* - Boxer / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer-Unknown Mix	Woodbury, MN	Male	Posted Breed: Boxer / Mixed (medium coat). Archie originally came to MN Boxer Rescue as a young puppy named Billy. Billy was the only survivor of a litter that contracted Parvo. His family renamed him Archie and he has been loved for 5 years. As with most Parvo puppies, the immune system is often affected and Archie has issues with allergies. He has always been an itchy boy - his family has tried every food type including the prescription food diet and both over-the-counter and prescription mediations to keep him comfortable. Until recently all that worked up to a point. Now with young children in the house, Archie is having more difficulties with the itching and discomfort. His ears get yeasty and sensitive. The dermatologist feels that the extra stress of young children and the added germs being brought into the house is causing his condition to worsen. His family has made the difficult decision to rehome him in order for Archie to be the happiest and healthiest dog he can be. Archie gets along with other dogs when he feels good, but might be a little crabby if he is in the middle of an outbreak and super sensitive. He is far too interested in cats and cannot be trusted with them. Older childrenthat can understand his needs and be gentle would be preferred over young kids, and a calmer home would also work better. Archie is looking for that special home that wants to snuggle and cuddle and keep him healthy and safe.                
03/19/2016	Harley (adoption pending) - American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Fredericksburg, VA	Male	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier (short coat). Harley is a big loveable guy who will bring nothing but happiness to your home. Harley was adopted out through our rescue as a puppy and has grown into a beautiful boy. Halet getsalomg wonderfully with his foster sister.  HaRiley, still a pupy at heart, loves to run and jump around outside, gets excited for walks and car rides. Harley does well when permitted to sleep outside of his kennel at night and will join you in bed, if permitted.    Harley attended a CGC training class and did very well. He has mastered commands like sit, stay, leave it and down.  HaRiley does well in the car, and would love to be your co-pilot in the front passenger seat, if permitted.   Harley loves to go on walks and be outside with his family. HArlen has a high energy level and needs plenty of walks, and outside play time. Harley would make a great jogging/running partner.  In the evening Harley loves to cuddle up on the couch against his humans. Harley is fine fine being crated ar night. In the morning you are guaranteed a happy greeting and when you come home there is nothing better than his big smile and wiggle butt. Harley would make a fine addition to any family.  Harley is housebroken but not good with cats.   Due to his high energy we recommend placing him in a home with children 8 and up.                
03/19/2016	RUSSO - American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	American Pit Bull Terrier	Belleville, MI	Male	Posted Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier (short coat). Big, Beefy, Blockhead, Blue Boy!Meet Russo, abandoned (with the now adopted Fiona) when their owners were evicted, taking or selling the 3-week old puppies and leaving the adults behind. They were living in the garage while the workers fixing up the house were desperately trying to find someone who could help them. And we couldn't leave them living in a garage, now could we?! Russo (pronounced Roo-So) is a nice guy who has been through the wringer. He has done extremely well with our volunteers working on his manners and he definitely aims to please his people... but he will still do best with someone with Bully Experience because he can still be a bit stubborn. He does well with most other dogs, is great in his crate, LOVES to play and loves to cuddle. He is a volunteer favorite and he will make the right someone a great dog!

03/19/2016	Boxer Sarge - Boxer Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boxer	Cincinnati, OH	Male	Posted Breed: Boxer. Meet Sarge. He is a 5-6 year old brindle Boxer who loves to curl up and snooze right next to you. He was recently neutered, and had a couple of BBs removed from under his skin. He's working hard to gain some weight, and is learning that no one is going to hurt him. He is currently living with another Boxer and an American Bulldog, who he gets along with very well. He also has a teacup poodle foster sister who he leaves alone. Probably not a good match for a cat, he was VERY curious about them at the veterinarian's office.He is completely housebroken, and enjoys going for a quick run around the back yard a few times a day. He seems okay on a leash, but hasn't been on any real walks since he arrived in his foster home.He is quickly learning that he doesn't need to bark at the neighbors when he is out back, that they are friendly and won't hurt him. He is still easily startled if touched or bumped roughly while sleeping. We make sure to wake him first, get down on his level and use a treat to encourage him to move. This isn't necessary very often, he always jumps right up if you open the door and ask if he wants to go outside.He is perfectly well behaved when left home alone. He's never chewed on anything or had an accident. He is tall though, so you will want to make sure any food is away from the edge of the counter. Please complete an application if you are interested in Sarge the Boxer!

03/19/2016	Rosie - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Englewood, CO	Female	Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (short coat). Rosie came into rescue from a rural shelter in New Mexico. Because we have little history on her, we are guessing her breed to be a Lab mix and estimating her to be around 1 year old. When Rosie came to her foster home she was a sad and scared and unsure about how to be a regular dog.During the last month surrounded with the love and patience of her foster family she has learned that humans are good and that she won't be abandoned. She has learned that she doesn't have to hoard her toys and food. She LOVES being with her foster family (especially the kids) and loves her doggie foster brother, Tank. She is great on a leash and likes to run. She has learned sit, kennel and leave it and thrives having a consistent routine. She is doing well with house training but may need to adapt to her new routing when she gets to her new home. Rosie needs a family who will continue to work on helping her gain more self confidence and who will provide her with a loving, calm and consistent home. If you are interested in adopting Rosie please submit an adoption application located on our website, www.coloradocaninerescue.org. She is spayed, microchipped and vaccinated. We are asking for a $175 adoption donation. As with any of our dogs, we are guessing at her age and breed.

Queen Mary is the perfect size for any living arrangement or adventure; big enough to go hiking with and small enough to lay under your chair at a restaurant. Snuggling will always be her favorite activity. It may take her a week or two to come out of her shell in a new place with new people, but once she does she'll be all about going where you do or thrilled to see you when you get home. She really wants to please you and will work hard to learn and be her best self for you.  Queen Mary would be ok sharing a house with other dogs as long as they respect her space and aren't rude or pushy. If you're looking to add a little royalty to your home, come meet Mary! If you have questions, please email adopt@austinpetsalive.org.

You MUST complete the adoption application and be approved before we will set up a meet and greet! Our ""main"" and/or founding location is in Crenshaw, MS, approximately an hour south of Memphis, TN. Our county has NO animal control, therefore we get a LOT of dogs and puppies dumped on our property and many, many of them are abandoned, abused, emaciated...just plain neglected their whole lives.... so of course we do anything and everything possible to get them ""adoptable"", but along with that comes 1000's and 1000's of dollars in vet bills.

03/19/2016	Rizzo - Australian Shepherd / Cattle Dog / Mixed Dog For Adoption	rescue	Australian Shepherd-Unknown Mix	Incline Village, NV	Female	Posted Breed: Australian Shepherd / Cattle Dog / Mixed. *** COURTESY LISTING *** PLEASE CALL OR E-MAIL THE PERSON LISTED. DO NOT CONTACT WARF AS WE HAVE NO FURTHER INFO. This cute 1 year old mini aussie/cattle dog with stumpy tail came from a NV shelter to Sparks.She is an awesome girl, and a great size at 21 pounds.Rizzo is also the greatest escape artist her foster home has seen in a while. She absolutely hates being in a pen and wants nothing more than get out and be with her people. She can jump 5-6ft with ease and then like a monkey pulls herself over the top of her pen to free herself. For that reason she will only be adopted out to a home with a setup that does not allow an escape and will keep her safe. Which means any unsupervised outside time can only be in a covered dog kennel with solid welded wire or chain-link and a solid floor where she cannot dig out or pull on the fencing to make a hole in it. The main point is - she hates kennels.She is crate trained, really loves her crate. Loves treats. Loves to play with other dogs.Rizzo also very much loves to run around off-leash, she has lots of energy. Leashed walks only will not make her happy, she needs to be able to stretch her legs and race about.This young girl is very attached to her people. Her ideal family has at least one other dog to play with and is very active with long hikes or runs. She would excel in agility and get you all the ribbons you can possibly win. Rizzo would also learn to heard ranch animals, she is very smart and as cattle dog mix she has the natural urge to herd the horses at her foster home.She is spayed, micro-chipped and vaccinated. Please contact her foster mom at APHApaints@yahoo.com An adoption fee, adoption contract and home visit applies

03/19/2016	LUCKY - Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Labrador Retriever-Unknown Mix	Pittsburgh, PA	Male	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Mixed (medium coat). Hi!  Thanks for giving me some attention! I'd like you to know that I've already been spayed or neutered. At Animal Friends, dogs and cats also leave fully up-to-date on shots and microchipped. All I need now is to find someone who will love me.   Please ask to meet with an adoption counselor, so we can be properly introduced and talk about what kind of pet you're looking for. We can discuss whether you're looking for a lap pet or a social butterfly, an ""only pet"" or a furry ""sibling"" for kids or other animals.   Best of all, by adopting from Animal Friends, you make it possible for them to rescue and care for another pet who truly needs help. So, what are you waiting for?

03/19/2016	Kuma - Corgi / Coonhound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Pembroke Welsh Corgi-Unknown Mix	Palo Alto, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Corgi / Coonhound / Mixed (short coat). We will be at the Palo Alto Pet Food Express Saturday, March 19th and Sunday, March 20th from 12-3pm. * If you are interested in a dog, please first read the biography on the dog (keep scrolling down for the bio!) and then go to our website, www.dpsrescue.com for an application. * We do not have a facility. All dogs live in foster homes. Arrangements to meet dogs occur after an approved application has been accepted. * We do not ship our dogs for any reason. * Our adoption fee is $400 for each dog/puppy. * If it is on a weekend of our adoptions, follow us on @DPSRescue on Twitter to get real time updates on our adoptions. We will also post at the end of the evening the names of those dogs who have been adopted: www.facebook.com/DPSRescueThis dog will be at Palo Alto Pet Food Express on Saturday, March 19th and Sunday, March 20th from 12-3pm or until adopted. If you would like the first opportunity to adopt, please fill out an application to be considered. Kuma is a 2 year old Corgi-Coonhound mix with the coloring of a Coon and the stubby legs of a Corgi. He's the perfect medium-sized dog, weighing in around 40 lbs! We rescued Kuma from a shelter, but he sure does seem to know and love humans. His foster dad reported that he likes to lay on the couch with his head in your lap, and will sleep cuddled up next to you if you let him! He understands the crate, though he'd rather not spend his time there. He's a pretty mellow guy when in the house with his people. When the leash comes out, Kuma can't wait to go for his walk! He's an energetic boy on-leash but won't knock you over. Kuma doesn't seem to have any formal training and would benefit from a session of obedience school or other basic doggy 101 class. Kuma could go to a home with another dog, but he will need a proper introduction and time to adjust. Kuma is an option for a home that has had a dog in the past 3 years. He is an option for a home with children over the age of 10. Because he is still new to our rescue, this may change, so stay tuned. A healthy pet is a happy pet!

We want to make sure if you are interested in a dog that we have the dog at adoptions but that can only happen if you fill out an application ahead of time and are pre-approved. (Generally this must happen prior to the weekend) **If you are wanting to submit an application within 24 hours of an event, please print off the application and bring with you as well as submitting it. You may still submit it and if time and volunteers permit, we will contact you. Most applications submitted the weekend of adoptions are not responded to until after the adoption weekend.

03/19/2016	ROLLO - Husky / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Palmer, AK	Male	Posted Breed: Husky / Mixed (medium coat).

Because he came to the shelter without previous owner information before us, there was no way to predict how fearful and anxious he truly is. Spooky will need a home that will be dedicated to training him and making him feel safe. He did interact well with children and other dogs when he was taken to the pet store. Spooky is also easy going, friendly, affectionate, quiet, nervous and shy.

03/19/2016	Bert & Ernie - Boston Terrier (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Boston Terrier	Huntington Beach, CA	Male	Posted Breed: Boston Terrier (short coat). Barking News!!!! The bold, the beautiful, the bodacious, bonded Boston brothers, Bert and Ernie, are new to the Buddy block and are on the hunt for a FOSTER or better yet FUREVER HOME to call their own. Bert and Ernie joined the Boston Buddy crew when their owner no longer had the time to care for them. These two are actually brothers from birth and at just 8 years young, Bert and Ernie are in the prime of their lives! Full of spunk and personality, the boys are ready and waiting for a good game of fetch (Bert’s absolute favorite), a sweet springtime hike through the hills, or a nice sunbath chewing a bone—whatever is on the agenda, these bros are more than ready and are patiently waiting to partake! Both Bert and Ernie are in spry shape, hearty (30lbs & 25lbs), and quite healthy—neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, and heart worm/fecal tested (both negative). Our bonded Boston boys are sure to make the best house guests or furever family members, we promise you that! They have those strong Black Satin Gentlemen manners; they are house trained, respond to their names, and know how to “sit” when asked. Bert and Ernie would thrive in a home where they are the only pups in the pack. While Bert is a social butterfly, Ernie is quite choosey with his puppy pals and prefers his brother Bert best, but a good brother is the absolute best friend in a boys life anyways right?! Bert and Ernie are super sweet with one another and enjoy sunshine snoozes in their bed together or sharing their breakfasts and dinners at meal time. Just one look at these beautiful boys and we’re certain you’ll absolutely swoon. Our tail wagging “twofur” is ready to bring a double dose of delight in to your life and is more than deserving of some springtime sunshine in a FOSTER or FUREVER HOME of their own. If you’re ready and willing to open your heart and home to two bonded brothers in need please fill out a foster or adoption application on our website  www.bostonbuddies.org  or email us at contactus@bostonbuddies.org Bert and Ernie will be furever grateful.

03/19/2016	CABOODLE - Lhasa Apso (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Lhasa Apso	Boston, MA	Male	Posted Breed: Lhasa Apso (medium coat). MEET CABOODLE!This fluffy little man can''t wait to bring a smile to your face! He is very friendly and outgoing and loves to go for walks around the neighborhood. He loves his treats and loves to show off, and he would be a great candidate for obedience classes! Due to some reported resource guarding in his previous home, Caboodle should not go home with young children who might not understand that they would need to leave his toys alone. He gets along great with other dogs, but due to his resource guarding, he would do best as the only pet in the home. He has also shown some stranger danger, so a potential adopter would need to be counsled on these behaviors before taking him home. If you are interested in meeting this cute little man, please come down to our adoption center today!For more information on CABOODLE or any of the other animals currently residing at the Animal Rescue League of Boston, please contact us @ 617-226-5602.

Sweet ole Huck is 6-8 yrs young, a Beagle/Lab Mix who was an owner surrender (they moved and could not take Huck with them). He will arrive in NYC from Georgia on Friday, February 26, 2016. This boy is ready for his forever home, he has been in foster care since February 2015! IOHR receives many dogs from Georgia as people do not have a mindset that dogs are family companions, many are viewed as 'throw-aways"".Apply now for this sweet bundle of cuddles and love...give him the 2nd chance he so richly deserves!!FOSTER NOTES: Huck plays well with others and is the sweetest dog we have. He desperately wants loving. He loves to play tag with you, but will come back for a little lovin'. Huck is indifferent to cats. Does not use his kennel. Although he is fine with our other dog, he will make an excellent only animal pet. He really doesn't play with toys. Mainly, he just wants interaction with his human. Huck definitely needs a home with fencing. Preferably, a home where you can just open your back door and he is still contained. Huck is not an escape artist, but because he is part Beagle, he will try to climb.                "

03/19/2016	Rockefeller - Labrador Retriever / Border Collie / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Borador	Richardson, TX	Male	"Posted Breed: Labrador Retriever / Border Collie / Mixed (medium coat). Meet Rockefeller and hear about his life during the last year!      A good samaritan was at a gas station close to a year ago when she saw a car load of teens sitting in a vehicle with 2 little puppies in their possession. She walked up to see the puppies and they basically said ""take them"". Knowing they weren't in good hands she did. She successfully adopted out one of them and decided to keep Rockefeller.       Rockefeller is a year old. Best guess he is a lab/border collie mix. He is super smart and high energy. With other small children and smaller cats and dog in the house, it will be best for Rockefeller to be in a different home.      This family loves Rockefeller but does not feel it is fair for him to be excluded from the family as is sometimes necessary. He deserves more. He He does very well listening to mom but on the weekends when traveling dad and all the kids are home, it is too rambunctious of an environment for Rockefeller.      Rockefeller is a good dog. He plays well with dogs his size and bigger. He needs a job with boundaries.  He would be great at agility or a running buddy for someone that can guide him. He needs consistency and he needs to know he is not in charge. He would do best with a family that has another dog and teenagers. Approx. birthday is 3/17/2015.

03/19/2016	Spring-Shelter - Hound / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Rustburg, VA	Female	Posted Breed: Hound / Mixed (short coat). Is this your beautiful spayed dog? She was picked up in the Hyland Springs area, on Lynbrook Road. We know she is spayed, and she is microchipped, as it was traced back to the rescue in South Carolina that inserted the chip. Bad news: the chip is not registered because it was mixed up with one put in another dog who is no longer living. These things happen occasionally, and it's extremely frustrating. In the meantime, this gorgeous gal we are calling SPRING is waiting for her family at the Campbell County Shelter, 434.821.4416    If not reclaimed, she will be available for adoption once her hold time is up,  you can apply at www.friendsofcampbellcounty.org
